Neither this, nor loads of other things are any of their fucking business. They are here to guarantee a free society. That means free from their interference as much as anything else
2	39299104	39298572	Bob_Helpful	21	11 August 2014 11:28am	But if you have nothing to hide you shouldn't be scared. No innocent person has ever suffered from police injustice *wibbles*
3	39299419	39299104	TheGreatRonRafferty	34	11 August 2014 11:35am	Quite right, how silly of me! I shall therefore give them a sample of my DNA, a fully itemised list of where I intend to travel, who I am travelling with, my car registration, everything I do on the computer, a copy of every letter, parcel and card I send through the post, the name of everyone I have ever known, every shop I have been in, my credit card number and code, and hand in my bank accounts for regular scrutiny. Oh, but they have almost all of that already ................. Except (to the best of my knowledge) my DNA. But should I be caught parking illegally, then I'm sure there's a case for them to collect that too.
4	39299833	39298572	OrangeLagoon	12	11 August 2014 11:43am	That's not true. They damn well wouldn't have a camera on themselves.
5	39300029	39299833	TheGreatRonRafferty	13	11 August 2014 11:47am	Oh, I don't know. It could go wrong at crucial moments. Purely by technical coincidence, naturally.

8	39302085	39298572	OldBristolian	35	11 August 2014 12:35pm	On top of Ron's points I'd add that the police have a poor understanding of Data Protection Act rules i.e. what they can share with which organisations with/without consent. GP's are pretty good at this. Even when they share personal data with a hospital consultant as part of a referral they obtain the patient's consent. Conversely, Social Workers regularly phone up my GP wife asking for patient medical details - she says "Fine - just fax me through the patient consent" and that's the last she hears of it. Whether they are actually ignorant of the law or just trying it on, I don't know. Your medical records are between you and your GP and nobody has access to them without your consent. There are one or two exceptions, child protection but even then the GP has to decide whether to share with social services and only if he/she shares those concerns. This suggestion goes completely against what we have in place now and should be resisted. Don't forget that once data has been shared, even if it was done illegally, it's practically impossible to repair the damage.
9	39302810	39298572	Pagey	21	11 August 2014 12:50pm	<blockquote>  the police would have a camera on everyone </blockquote>  If I ever have a colonoscopy, they're welcome to the footage so they know where they can stick their cameras.
10	39302823	39302085	snowcat3	6	11 August 2014 12:50pm	Generally speaking, I agree: our dealings with our GP should remain confidential unless we are specifically asked permission and give it. In the case of child protection concerns though, I feel the GP is given too much power. S/he might not "share the concerns" because s/he might be a poor reader of situations, s/he might well have fallen for the articulate charm of the abusing parent, etc. This is why we need a law on Mandatory Reporting; take it out of the "Let's leave it to the GP's discretion" category and put it in the "If you don't report child abuse concerns to the authorities, you are guilty of a crime" category. Given the chance to do nothing, a lot of people will do exactly that: nothing.  I do feel that's the exception. The idea of the police routinely accessing our medical records is repellant. To begin with, what makes them think that everything in our medical records is even accurate? I know that quite a lot of my own records, the parts of them concerning my mental health issues, are riddled with factual inaccuracies and nasty value judgements. And it is virtually impossible to get such "info" corrected or excised.
11	39304160	39299833	ABasu	3	11 August 2014 1:18pm	Aren't the police trialling having cameras on themselves to record all interactions with the public?
12	39305465	39298572	salamandertome	3	11 August 2014 1:41pm	The police need to learn that claiming that it will help them catch 'paedos and terrorists' will help them get whatever intrusive permissions they need. Or is that excuse reserved for central government?

Given the chance to do nothing, a lot of people will do exactly that: nothing. You have to bear in mind that GPs are trained to the highest level (level 3) in child protection. Teachers are trained to level 1 and some of them to level 2. Ironically, the chance to do nothing is something most people, especially teachers, can't live with - they can't own the risk and need to pass the buck to social services, hence all the unnecessary referrals. It takes some balls to say "I've been alerted to this issue but weighing up all the factors I don't think this warrants reporting to social services". But you have to remember that legally, disclosing someone's information without good reason a.k.a. to be on the safe side, is as serious an offence as not disclosing something when you should have. It's a difficult balance but it's crucial to get things as accurate as possible as leaving someone with a social services record without justification and sharing someone's personal information without justification is potentially damaging to that individual and they can quite rightly seek redress and penalties for the individual who shared their data inappropriately. You can't go smearing people with a social services investigation 'just to be on the safe side'. It has to be justified on the balance of evidence and taking all factors into account. You can guarantee the 'just to be on the safe side' brigade have never been on the receiving end of an unjustified referral and have a record they shouldn't. Going back to your scenario, the GP (and anyone else speaking to social services) can and should only comment on what they know. If the GP has no concerns that is all he or she should say. Sharing medical information can only be done if the GP has concerns e.g. the child is often being brought in with bruises, doesn't look well etc and, to be frank, had this happened the GP would have raised the issue anyway. Same goes for teachers - they should advise they have no concerns if they have none based on what they know or choose to share if what social services are saying chimes with what they know of that child, based on facts, not opinion. What's needed is better training in child protection and the right sort of people in positions to make what are difficult decisions. As I said, it takes some balls to decide that a scenario doesn't need a referral and to stand by that decision. Presently we have situations where teachers didn't spot a child stealing food from bins and yet others getting all panicky when 11-12 year olds are using sexual language (quite normal of course).
14	39308005	39304160	OrangeLagoon	2	11 August 2014 2:30pm	Yes I think they are. And hopefully, joking about camera malfunctions aside, it will prove useful.
15	39308603	39298572	gtegte	2	11 August 2014 2:44pm	The Police? Nope its the state that wants to control everything. Leftist statist nonsense abounds. Pre crime Pre distribution Pre taxation It's all about the state screwing the public and the left are cheering it on.

Lack of policing? Very difficult. Its policy. Same applies to the NHS. Film neglect and chaos, and its exposed. Difficultly arises when its policy. Record your conversations with the tax man. Can I claim for X? Yes. Claim for it. If they dispute it, its out with the tape. Tell your mates too. Same for companies. Divorce. Here's the mix tape of my spouse's behaviour.  .... I think the state has more to lose from the cameras being turned.
20	39321664	39299104	mcole003	0	11 August 2014 8:17pm	There is nothing wrong with my genitals but I would object to the authorities having access to them without my consen.
21	39298678		whatithink	30	11 August 2014 11:18am	It should be recognised as the duty of every police officer to preserve freedom. If it were, we'd have to sack the senior officers we have, who evidently have no concept of a free society at all.
22	39301555	39298678	conanthebarbarian	18	11 August 2014 12:23pm	I was brought up to believe that the Police (then called the Police Force before they decided Police Service sounded more friendly) were there to guarantee our freedoms.

27	39304537	39298870	mattmcneany	14	11 August 2014 1:25pm	Id be far more concerned about the idea of the police, upon taking someone into custody having the capacity to check medical records. I suspect the exchange would go something like this:  <blockquote>  Mr Bloggs I know we brought you in for a drunk and disorderly but your medical records show you're on a methadone program so we'll need to hold you in custody whilst we search you residence fro Heroin. </blockquote>
28	39298873		Imageark	21	11 August 2014 11:23am	That aside, don't forget to opt out of the NHS Summary Care Record.  Style of thing
29	39298956		pharos	44	11 August 2014 11:24am	Given the ease with which the late News of the World was able to illegally obtain information from police officers, this would not end well.
30	39299192	39298956	TheGreatRonRafferty	52	11 August 2014 11:30am	Quite. I'm guessing though that Parliament would allow them only to view the records of the plebs. Politicos, their families and wider relatives, Royalty and "personalities" would be exempt. Know your place!
31	39299135		MutantNinjaThinktank	27	11 August 2014 11:28am	<blockquote>  The problem is helping the vulnerable has become crisis management. But the solution is to take the police out of the matrix as far as possible, not to draw them in to this absurd and counterproductive extent. </blockquote>  The police are on call 24/7; and at 3am when there's nobody else to take charge of vulnerable adults or children, they have no choice but to do their best. That usuallly involves ringing a duty social worker who can do eff all, or maybe the local council to rehouse someone who's got nowhere else to go, and they're not always able to do so.  In my view, Deborah is slightly contradicting herself in this article; <blockquote>  It's a good thing the police now recognise that the majority of the people who come to their attention are vulnerable and find it hard to do what's best for themselves, let alone what's best for those around them. </blockquote>  And then; <blockquote>  However, far from being an indication that the police need more power, it's a sign that they are now straying too far from their remit, which is to maintain law and order. Fahy himself talks of having an ability "to solve the problem without a criminal justice system approach". </blockquote>  The Police can't maintain law and order when the disorder is caused by people with mental health issues; except by locking them in a cell. It might be that we should have less police and more social workers, but I suspect thats going to be a hard idea to sell to the public. In the meantime; if we're going to use the police as social workers and mental health nurses; lets give them the tools to do the job.
32	39304006	39299135	HarryTheHorse	27	11 August 2014 1:15pm	<blockquote>  if we're going to use the police as social workers and mental health nurses; lets give them the tools to do the job. </blockquote>  How will giving them access to medical records that they will not understand give them the tools to the job? It will likely make things worse by causing them to over-react and use disproportionate force if they see something in the report that they do not like the look of.
33	39304295	39299135	retreat33	9	11 August 2014 1:20pm	'...Locking them in a police cell.' Is that so PC Plod can go there later, to kill the ill person? Quite often, it seems.

35	39310544	39304006	Remoxnoir	1	11 August 2014 3:29pm	Ever heard of police surgeons? The police refer to them when necessary.

37	39311350	39299135	bobbysixty	0	11 August 2014 3:49pm	I can see how it would be useful if the police were aware that the person they'd just arrested for causing a disturbance wasn't drunk, but perhaps suffering some sort of medical condition or mental health issue. In which case locking them up for the night to 'sleep it off' wouldn't help, and might cause more harm than good. However, it's what the police actually do with that information that needs to be addressed. Surely we don't expect the police to be medical personnel and social workers as well as law enforcement? There needs to be greater interaction between social workers and medical services and the police. I would be in favour of not full access to all confidential records of everyone, but for some relevant information to be accessible in the case of people considered vulnerable. For example if a person was in need of regular medication etc.
38	39311801	39311350	SuburbanHomeboy	0	11 August 2014 4:00pm	I would hope that any person in need of regular medication would be wearing an appropriate medical alert bracelet/necklace. I certainly would if I had a medical condition that could cause me to appear to be drunk or even pass out in a public place. No need to give police additional powers, just make it compulsory to have this kind of notification device about your person.
39	39312300	39311801	bobbysixty	2	11 August 2014 4:12pm	<blockquote>  just make it compulsory to have this kind of notification device about your person. </blockquote>  Hard to enforce though. And what if not taking your meds makes you forget to put your bracelet on? Would you prefer to be tattooed with a barcode instead?
40	39320521	39311801	AntHopkins	1	11 August 2014 7:43pm	So what medications would you include in your compulsory display list? Insulin? Antidepressants? Antipsychotics?
41	39340992	39299135	SteveRP	2	12 August 2014 9:58am	Or, more importantly, give them the training to do a social worker's job. While we are at it, why not train them as paramedics and doctors and psychiatrists. Perhaps they could be trained as lawyers, that would save a lot of problems. I'm pretty sure that your average policeman is a polymath just waiting for his/her latent talent to be unleashed (purely for the benefit of society) and just needs the tools to get on with it. Why do we need all these specialists when the police can do it all? After all, there are no cases where the police have misused and abused the powers and tools they already have, we can trust them to do the right thing.
42	39299196		Patrician	16	11 August 2014 11:30am	I agree. The police are in an impossible position here because they're the ones who are the first point of contact for mentally ill people when an incident occurs, and they're the ones who get it in the neck if something goes wrong, because they aren't trained to deal with them. Investment is needed so police can be trained and specialists - who work with the police, but are not part of them - are immediately available to assess individuals to see who can be retained in custody and who needs to go to a specialist hospital.
43	39306028	39299196	HarryTheHorse	17	11 August 2014 1:50pm	<blockquote>  Investment is needed so police can be trained and specialists - who work with the police, but are not part of them - are immediately available to assess individuals to see who can be retained in custody and who needs to go to a specialist hospital. </blockquote>  That is the correct, but more expensive, approach. Giving untrained officers access to files intended for medical professionals can only end badly. I am sure that they wouldn't want doctors reading police intelligence reports and making decisions based on those reports. They would surely say that doctors don't have the experience and training to draw the correct deductions from the reports!
44	39299498		carcetti	34	11 August 2014 11:36am	As it seems we can't trust the police, it's probably a bad idea to grant them even more access to personal information about individuals. If I were a vulnerable person who had been a victim of crime, knowing the police could access my medical records without my consent would probably dissuade me from coming forward.
45	39299763		lisalane	17	11 August 2014 11:42am	I'm going against the flow here but I can see at least one good reason for police having access to medical records. A particular incident when a close relative of mine went to the police and accused my partner and myself of physically abusing her as a child. She also accused us of deliberately starving our daughter.The police quite correctly had to act when she made these statement to them. They took her statement and began an investigation which resulted in a police visit to our home and interviewing me and my partner and even our 12 year old daughter. It was only when the police spoke to us that I was able to inform them that the allegations were impossible due to the time period and location that these incidents supposedly happened. But, most importantly, the police were unaware of our accusers mental health problems. She was being treated for schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder. The accusations against us were only the latest of many bizarre accusations against others, including a local cafe she accused of poisoning her hot chocolate.I was amazed that the police had not checked the reliability of our accuser by accessing her medical records before setting in train an investigation that over months deeply upset and worried us, involved children's services and caused massive fall out within our family as a whole. But they told me they were unable to do that check on her, and would only have considered doing it, once the case had came to court and if our lawyer had asked for the information to be produced. One phone call to her GP could have prevented the whole fiasco if they had been allowed access to her records.
46	39300207	39299763	Swan17	34	11 August 2014 11:51am	Yes and no. I fully understand your position as the equivalent happened to me (accused of assault, arrested by the Police as part of their investigation and then all dropped when they got the full facts). However just because someone has mental health issues does not mean that nothing happened. I would argue that the Police MUST investigate any and every accusation. Tricky, very tricky but I can see it from their point of view. At the end of the day who will be blamed if something goes wrong - them!
47	39300236	39299763	carcetti	19	11 August 2014 11:52am	This sounds like a horrible situation but it doesn't give anyone the right to access someone's medical records without their consent. Regardless of other considerations, your medical history is your own and should be private.
48	39300247	39299763	TheGreatRonRafferty	26	11 August 2014 11:52am	I am afraid that you have badly misjudged the point. Even if they DID know your accuser's mental problems, and mental history, they would still have carried on regardless. Indeed, you'll find lots of Guardian articles suggesting that they SHOULD do so. Whether or not they were able to access her records would not have made a blind bit of difference.
49	39301639	39300247	lisalane	3	11 August 2014 12:25pm	Well, as I stated:  <blockquote>  The police quite correctly had to act </blockquote>  But surely they should have had the full information about the accuser when acting in such an accusation?As it turned out the police were quite miffed when they discovered they had spent so much time and effort on a case that could easily have been spotted as bogus if they'd had the medical info. They even asked me if I wished to make a complaint against my accuser, as they were now considering charging her with wasting police time. I declined as I felt they just wanted a conviction, one way or another, to justify their investigation.
50	39301697	39299763	conanthebarbarian	27	11 August 2014 12:27pm	An interesting case. But it borders on proposing the idea that mentally ill people are all liars who can't be trusted. And its just a tad more complex than that. PS I'm someone who has had mental health issues in life. I don't like the suggestion that if I ever accuse anyone of anything my mental health will be used as something to count against the veracity, or not, of anything I might have to say.
51	39303099	39299763	OldBristolian	6	11 August 2014 12:56pm	The police quite correctly had to act when she made these statement to them.. I'm not so sure. You and your partner are now 'known to social services' when you absolutely should not be. I don't know what you do but if, for example, you were a GP you would have to declare on your annual appraisal that you had been reported to social services even though they found no issues. What if you were a teacher and that fact got out? It's a smear - no smoke without fire - even though there was no fire in this case. What if your daughter breaks her arm at the park and when you take her into A&E the alarm bells start ringing because you are 'known to social services'? This is why the police - in conjunction with social services - should carry out a balanced assessment before they go marching in and accusing people or even investigating in a big way. For example, who else had raised concerns about you, did teachers have concerns, what did your GP think? In short - what are the balancing factors?  Things need to be triaged properly as a lot of things are reported which are either pure nonsense or are below a threshold requiring social services involvement. Social services - certainly in our area - reject 70% or referrals made and that tells you they receive and rightly reject a lot of rubbish, and that includes people/neighbours with a grudge. These records they now hold on you stay around for 75 years and they should not exist because it was a bogus accusation. Too many people say better to be safe than sorry but being safe incorrectly creates potentially damaging records - it's not a benign process - they don't wipe the slate clean if nothing is found. Do you actually know what data social services and the police hold about you and whether it's accurate? For the sake of £10 a pop I'd be obtaining Subject Access Requests from both organisations to find out exactly who said what and whether it is true. Did your daughter's school talk to social services? Did the school provide information to them without your consent? They shouldn't have unless they themselves had genuine concerns for your daughter (which it sounds like they couldn't possibly have had)? I'm sorry if you're trying to put this unpleasant episode behind you and I'm raking it up but based on experience, I'd be finding out exactly what data the various agencies in your unfortunate case hold on you, your partner and your daughter.
52	39303173	39301639	Blaydon	9	11 August 2014 12:57pm	But this is very revealing, isn't it, of what might happen if the police discover someone they're dealing with has a mental health problem. Not only, as RonRafferty has pointed out, should someone with a metal health problem be listened to regardless but, also, the response of the police in this case, was to suggest prosecuting the person for waiting police time. No suggestion of wanting to act as mental health professionals here. Just more of this, presumably: http://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/help-information/mental-health-statistics/prisons/
53	39303176	39300236	snowcat3	7	11 August 2014 12:57pm	Phoning the GP and asking about the person's background could well have helped though. It would have given them a clearer picture. I do accept that all allegations have to be investigated, nonetheless: plenty of people with mental health issues (and diagnoses) have been abused as children.  I think there's a big difference between speaking over the phone to someone's GP and actually wading through someone's medical files. Lisalane, I'm rather taken aback that you were surprised that the police "even" wanted to speak to your daughter. Given that the allegation mentioned her and possible abuse, of course they would want to speak to her privately; taking the word of the parents only in this scenario would be a failure to do their job.
54	39303354	39303176	carcetti	8	11 August 2014 1:01pm	Look, I can think of lots of situations where it might be helpful to the police to be able to access someone's medical records. That's not at issue. Obviously it can be helpful. The issue is whether the police have a right to it. Medical information is about the most sensitive personal information there is. It is parted with on the basis that it is completely private and it should remain so.
55	39303561	39301639	TheGreatRonRafferty	4	11 August 2014 1:05pm	I've remarked on this case before, but I'll pass it on again. A woman accused her doctor (same practice as our's but not our doctor) of sexual assault. It was widely known in the local area that she had done the same thing several times before with various other men in the district, but the case churned on for well over a year with regular newspaper updates re the Dr, his suspension, and the allegations. The woman of course was not mentioned by name (though it being a country area, her name was widely known. After about 18 months, the case was dropped, the doctor returned to work, and the slate supposedly wiped clean.
56	39313189	39301639	MiIney	2	11 August 2014 4:33pm	<blockquote>  But surely they should have had the full information about the accuser when acting in such an accusation? </blockquote>  You're suggesting that they should not have investigated, if they had known that this person had a history of mental illness. Sorry but that's just another argument against this plan - these people are already some of the most vulnerable and preyed upon in our society. What you're suggesting is that they effectively have a flag against their name so that if they ever make a complaint it gets ignored because of their condition - suddenly open season on people with mental illness as people know that their complaints will never be investigated. Then we get on to the other half of your horrendous suggestion - if you ever report a crime to the police, they'll dig through your medical records to 'judge your character'. What a massive incentive to report crimes, not only do you get to do your civic duty, but police will dig through your medical records as an added perk!
57	39314617	39299763	HomerJS	2	11 August 2014 5:06pm	Interesting point, but surely if the police were actually doing their own job properly they would have had access to their own records of the number of false complaints raised by this person. No need to access the medical records, just make sure the police records are complete and accessible.

This is the record they should have been checking - her medical records have nothing to do with it.  I wouldn't be surprised if this person did have some kind of serious abuse in their past, hence it coming out in this weird way of wild accusations (it would not be the first time). I can't imagine the hell of having schizophrenia and BPD together. People diagnosed BPD are very likely to have been abused and are generally abused again by the system - it's known as a 'dustbin diagnosis' and seen as ok to neglect or bully people with that diagnosis. So, so cruel, considering people with BPD have an incredibly low tolerance to emotional pain.  I write this as your whole post stinks of "oh, i'm a normal person and this horrible mental person made it so hrd for me!" - she's been through/is going through hell every day.
60	39300133		BewilderedMark	40	11 August 2014 11:50am	My brother in law has a number of mental health issues including paranoid schizophrenia. Fifteen or twenty years ago when he first started receiving treatment there was a local crisis team made up of experienced mental health nurses operating county-wide 24/7. Typical response times were measured in minutes rather than hours or days. Now when he has an 'episode' the police are deployed as a first response. Mental health professionals only attend hours, sometimes days later to make a brief visit/assessment (depending on whether an arrest has been made). This is, in part, due to the crisis teams having been cut back massively (24/7 cover is expensive to maintain, especially when there are sometimes no call outs to justify the expense) and those experienced nurses who have retired have not been replaced. He was rarely violent when the nurses he knew and trusted were on the response team, but now with any 20 year old copper being deployed without knowing the details can be very distressing for everyone involved. The shocking state of mental health care provision is partly to blame - but mental healthcare beds are being cut everywhere without there being adequate support for sufferers living in the community. There's only so much family support that can be offered when everyone has to go out and earn a living.
61	39300197		SirTalbotBuxomly	22	11 August 2014 11:51am	The state have a terrible record of holding peoples' personal data securely as it stands. GPs are one exception - they are pretty good at holding data and NOT releasing it to anyone else without patient consent. Don't forget we are talking about <u>sensitive</u> personal data here. Also one of the Data Protection Act principles is that, to paraphrase, organisations should only have access to and hold personal data relevant to the task they need to undertake and it should not be excessing. This idea seems to go against that principle.
62	39304525	39300197	ABasu	1	11 August 2014 1:25pm	Although there is a power under s251 of the NHS Act 2006 for the Secretary of State to suspend the confidentiality of patient data and enable it to be disclosed where there is a medical benefit to the patient or it is too sensitive to make getting patient consent practicable. The proposal here sounds like one which could in theory be permitted by administrative action under that legislation.

Remember the lack of information given out, information given out at the last minute and the "letters" of their intentions and the obfuscated way of opting out not being delivered to households? There is an ongoing hidden agenda to make our medical records accessible to anyone willing to pay enough for the privilege. Everything will be a commodity unless we fight back.
64	39300251		JohntheLith	52	11 August 2014 11:52am	A couple of years ago I saw a young woman being dragged along the pavement by a man who had her in a head lock at 10.30pm. To keep it short, I told him to let her go, which he did and then he attacked me, punching me. Another passerby called the Police. When they arrived I showed them my injuries, already massive bruising appearing on my arms where I was punched. (I'm on blood thinners for a heart condition so bruise easily). However, on learning that I have mental health problems I was immediately surrounded by 8 PCs, identified as the cause of the problem and threatened with arrest. When I asked which Officer was in charge one sarcastically told me "no-one" which is clearly a lie. The bloke who assaulted me was sent on his way and a short time later I was too. This is how the Police treat the vulnerable when they have medical information on them.
65	39300359	39300251	JohntheLith	37	11 August 2014 11:55am	PS I put in a formal complaint and was thanked by the local Inspector for doing so he was able to ensure that the bloke who assaulted me was dealt with properly, as nothing would have been followed up on. As for the Officer who lied to me? He was unable to identify who it was as it was "an exceptionally busy night". That is, the 8 PCs present closed ranks and acted dumb/lied. Fuckers!
66	39300979	39300251	JohntheLith	33	11 August 2014 12:09pm	PPS There was also a comment from one of the PCs present at the time that it was a "domestic" and I shouldn't have got involved, which suggests to me the Fahy needs to do a lot of educating round the country to get Officers to take domestic violence seriously.
67	39301900	39300251	conanthebarbarian	34	11 August 2014 12:31pm	And this is why anyone with even the slightest history of any mental health problems in life (a vast range of conditions from very mild to completely debilitating) will tremble at the thought that the Police can call up such details, make their own (probably unwarranted) assumptions and act accordingly. The Police are corrupt enough as it is. We do not need them deciding that "mentals" are the problem which I don't doubt they already do.
68	39303667	39300979	snowcat3	27	11 August 2014 1:07pm	You've just succinctly shown why the police should not be given access to records. They are woefully undereducated about mental health issues just as they are woefully undereducated about domestic violence.  They are also, may I say, woefully undereducated about learning disability. My 15-year-son, who has severe learning disability and autism and who will never be independent (due to having no sense of danger either from traffic or from people), went AWOL one sunny afternoon. I called the police. When he had strolled back of his own accord, the police came round to the house and seemed completely unable to understand why he couldn't give a full account of where he had been and what he had been doing. (He has the speech of maybe a 3-year-old, and little or no understanding of why other people might be worried.) Throughout the whole incident I had been telling them that he has little sense of danger, that he is fully-able bodied but limited intellectually. . .they behaved as if they had never encountered such a person before! The police woman on the other end of the line repeatedly used the term "mental health issues."  The police don't need more powers. They need more education about human beings.
69	39305022	39303667	Roundearther	14	11 August 2014 1:34pm	I have heard serving police officers seriously questioning whether or not under-25s actually had human rights.

70	39300259		acehlortt	9	11 August 2014 11:52am	In any case where a victim of domestic abuse is deemed to be at a high risk of serious harm, information is already shared by health workers, social workers etc through a Marac, a multi agency risk assessment conference.
71	39300545		SteB1	26	11 August 2014 11:59am	<blockquote>  The Greater Manchester chief constable, Sir Peter Fahy, has told the Guardian the police want quick and easy access to medical and other confidential records without the consent of the individual concerned. In the light of other recent revelations about state incursion into private data, one is tempted to note that it's nice of them to ask. </blockquote> Thanks for the clear put down of this mad, bad and dangerous idea. I think that it should raise big questions about Sir Peter Fahy's competence.  Leaving aside any ulterior motives the police might have for this, such as smearing whistleblowers, something they apparently have a long history of - it is just ill thought out. It could only ever be used in a very arbitrary and piecemeal way. If the police think they have the resources to replace the NHS, the Social Services and other support agencies, then either they have got far more resources than they need, or they've simply lost the plot. This is not joined up thinking, it is completely the opposite. It is a type of thinking whereby someone has just made themselves willfully blind of all the contradictions. It also make you wonder if the police are considering a future dystopia where they foresee there will be lots of vulnerable people abandoned by the system. In which case they would be far better to criticise the cuts to essential services, and the situation its creating. This is far more within their remit. Finally this illustrates a very worrying Messiah Complex of senior police officers. The sign of a competent professional is a realistic appraisal of their capabilities. What makes the police think they are even competent to understand people's medical records? This fact alone says that senior police officers are choked with hubris, and need to be made far more publicly accountable for their actions. Plus it is very questionable as to whether supposed public servants should be speaking out on matters of policy, other than to highlight problems.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messiah_complex" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messiah_complex</a> What next, will Sir Peter Fahy be asking for the right of the police to intervene in international situations.

Or perhaps like his predecessor James Anderton, he has got a personal hotline to god.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Anderton" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Anderton</a> It is very telling that the former Chief Constable of Manchester James Anderton also had a close personal relationship (as well as god) with Cyril Smith.

72	39300683		philipphilip99	6	11 August 2014 12:03pm	The police are in a no win situation here - they can't look at medical records because it is alleged they can't be trusted and yet at the same time they're expected to diagnose a myriad of health problems and react accordingly.
73	39306920	39300683	Blaydon	9	11 August 2014 2:07pm	Surely it's not the case that the police are expected to 'diagnose a myriad of health problems and react accordingly'? They're expected to follow up reports and disturbances and then pass on cases for appropriate further action. They are specifically not supposed to act on any prejudices they might have, about mental illness or anything else, though of course anyone could be excused for thinking this sort of even-handedness doesn't always happen.
74	39308437	39300683	SE26lad	6	11 August 2014 2:40pm	Unless the officers are medically trained, access to medical records will render them no more able to react accordingly. It will simply waste time before they either have to take a chance anyway, or contact a medical professional. And that isn't a statement about police officers. It is a statement about anybody with no medical training.

77	39311549	39310398	Blaydon	2	11 August 2014 3:54pm	"What evidence is there of acting on prejudices?" Research on policing conducted in the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s indicated that racism and racial prejudice in police culture were more widespread and more extreme than in wider society. Studies found that 'racial prejudice and racialist talk . . . [were] pervasive . . . expected, accepted and even fashionable' (Smith and Gray 1985: 388-9) while negative views of people from ethnic minorities and support for extreme right political parties were widespread (Smith and Gray 1985; Holdaway 1983, 1997: 78; Reiner 2000: 98-100, 115-21).Research evidence over the past three decades has found that specific stereotypes are commonly used by police officers to classify people on the basis of their ethnic origin. Studies found that Asians tended to be regarded as devious, liars and potential illegal immigrants (Cain 1973; Graef 1989: 131; Jefferson 1993). The pliability of stereotypes of Asian and particularly Muslim people has been documented in recent research, which has suggested that perceptions of Asian and particularly Muslim people have undergone a transformation. Stereotypes, which assumed that Asian people were conformist, are now thought to be less applicable and rather, the very stereotypes assumed to explain law-abiding behaviour (e.g. family pressures, tight knit communities and high levels of social control) are now thought to promote criminal and deviant activity amongst Asian youth (Hudson and Bramhall 2005; Hudson 2007; Parmar 2007). The shift in the perception of such groups has been located in both local and global notions of Asian youth as increasingly involved in gangs, violent, disorderly, riotous and, more recently, as potential terrorists (Webster 1997; Alexander 2000; Goodey 2001).Stereotypes of black people have been more consistent in that they are thought to be more prone to violent crime and drug abuse, to be incomprehensible, suspicious, hard to handle, naturally excitable, aggressive, lacking brainpower, troublesome and 'tooled up' (Graef 1989; Reiner 1991). These findings have not been restricted to constables but have been found throughout the ranks (see Reiner 1991: 44). A 1997 inspection of community and race relations policies and practices within the police service conducted by Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Constabulary concluded that 'racial discrimination, both direct and indirect, and harassment are endemic within our society and the police service is no exception . . .' and that there was 'a direct and vital link between internal culture in the way people are treated and external performance' (HMIC 1997: 18). On the basis of the inspection and accounts of racist behaviour by police officers from members of the public, HMIC concluded that even 'if the majority of the accounts are dismissed as either the products of third party articulation or even exaggeration, a picture still emerges of pockets of wholly unacceptable racist policing' (1997: 18).

I despair the idea is even mooted.
83	39302138		HarryTheHorse	37	11 August 2014 12:36pm	This is absurd and dangerous on so many levels. Firstly, the police do not have the competence to read and use medical records. They are written for the benefit of clinicians, medically untrained police officers.  Second, and most important of all, medical records are highly confidential, and the information in them was disclosed on the strict understanding that it would not be handed out willynilly to anyone who thinks they should see it. It is matter of basic medical ethics. Medical records should be made available only if the patient approves it or in receipt of a court order. Third, I cannot imagine a worst custodian of sensitive medical information than the police. They have no credibility. Undoubtedly such information would be leaked by unscrupulous officers to newspapers and also used to discredit anyone who makes a complaint against the police. We are dealing here with an organization that thought it was acceptable to spy in the Lawrence family to protect the police service, not for any legitimate law-enforcement reason. No, no, no, no, no.

What does 'solving a problem without the use of the criminal justice system' mean exactly? They're the police. Criminal Justice is their remit isn't it? What are they going to do, start handing out plasters? Provide counselling session? Oh, hang on! A chill wind has just blown through my soul. I don't like the sound of this at all. The police aren't doctors and they shouldn't try to be. Some information is private. Not because it masks criminal activity but because people essentially like only people they trust knowing things about them. People whose job is to catch criminals going through personal records about someone's nervous breakdown or miscarriage or whatever isn't going to make people feel good about going to their doctor. That self-evident isn't it? This - unless some brilliant, non-PR speak response is forthcoming - is dangerous stuff. I just wish I knew what it was all in aid of. What do the police want?
94	39304126		koolkarmauk	10	11 August 2014 1:17pm	It is shocking that police cells are being utilized as a substitute for mental health wards with no bed space and as per with a Tory government has become the norm. I for one do not trust a society where justice depends on what or what isn't written in an individuals medical record given the appalling discrimination mental health users already experience on a daily basis in the UK today.
95	39304777	39304126	JohntheLith	12	11 August 2014 1:29pm	It is worse than you suggest. If a suspected criminal is held in custody in a Police cell that custody must be reviewed at least once every 24 hours. If a suspected mentally ill person is held in a Police cell as a "place of safety" under Section 135 and 136 that custody only needs to be reviewed every 72 hours. Or, the Law says that a suspected criminal is treated with 3 times more consideration/human rights than a suspected nutter.
96	39305138	39304777	koolkarmauk	8	11 August 2014 1:36pm	I had no idea that mental health users in custody do not actually have the same rights. When the police, I assume with no medical advice can make those decisions it won't be long before a trail of miscarriages of justice emerges. The media constantly portray mentally ill people as violent and unpredictable and so why on earth would the police have an "educated" informed view.
97	39308457	39304777	LittleGhost	3	11 August 2014 2:40pm	You were doing so well ...  <blockquote>  nutter </blockquote>  is completely unacceptable. It is a pejorative, an deeply unpleasant way to describe someone with possible mental health issues.

Do you really think that custody officers want to keep people in custody for 72 hours because its good fun? I despair.
99	39311019	39310318	JohntheLith	5	11 August 2014 3:40pm	I was once kept in custody overnight (admittedly not 72 hours) when I should have been taken to hospital, and taken to court the next morning only for the court to shout at the Police, "Why isn't this man in hospital?". PS I won't go into too much detail as it is a litany of failure and deliberate neglect. It was later found that I hadn't done anything wrong in the first place - I was severely mentally unwell and spent the next 3 months in hospital - and it was acknowledged that I should have been taken to hospital straight away - I have a 49 page apology saying so. The duty Inspector responsible for my welfare overnight did say to me that "people like you need to be taught a lesson" but I couldn't prove it. "People like me" - the mentally ill. The custody Sergeant responsible was "allowed" to resign whilst the investigation into my complaint was ongoing; the usual behaviour. Did they do this because it was fun? I dunno, but they certainly did it 'cos they could. The joys of being a "nutter".
100	39311212	39308457	JohntheLith	5	11 August 2014 3:46pm	The use of the word "nutter" was deliberate. I used the pejorative to emphasise how Society in general, but especially law enforcement in all it's forms, treats/views the mentally ill and disabled. Sometimes you have to hit bigots/bigoted systems between the eyes with their own prejudice. Admittedly it might have helped if I wrapped the words in parentheses... PS I have 4 mental health diagnoses and am classified as both mentally ill and disabled, so am talking about my people.
101	39312192	39310318	koolkarmauk	2	11 August 2014 4:10pm	" I despair" you appear to be suggesting "police surgeons" are qualified to make decisions involving mental illness that then can imprison innocent vulnerable patients for up to 72 hours in a police cell.
