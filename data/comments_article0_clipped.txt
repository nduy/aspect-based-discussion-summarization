2	38262154	38260242	brendon1	29	17 July 2014 9:28am	Plenty of people use compost bins and have no trouble with rats or foxes.
3	38262530	38262154	littleritchie	21	17 July 2014 9:36am	If they are well-designed and well-managed- which is very easily accomplished. If 75% of this borough composted their waste at home then they could have their bins collected every six-weeks. It's amazing what doesn't need to be put into landfill.
4	38262601	38262154	mresta	59	17 July 2014 9:38am	tell that to people who live in flats and have no access to compost bins.
5	38262916	38262601	brendon1	4	17 July 2014 9:44am	As far as I am aware, flats normally have sheds to put rubbish in, away from property. Even a small block of flats will normally have somewhere for temporary storage of rubbish.
6	38263529	38262530	Dave C	21	17 July 2014 9:56am	I suggest you visit the borough and look at the breakdown of the housing stock before spouting cliches.
7	38263546	38262154	Iccleste	15	17 July 2014 9:56am	Composting is for waste food. The black bin is for stuff that usually cannot be composted such as packaging - that comment doesn't solve or really relate to this. If the council randomly decides what services it will offer can we randomly decide how much we want to pay?

As you can see, the proposal is not aimed at properties with communal facilities.

Is Bury going to provide larger bins for families or provide bins for kitchen and garden waste to cut down the amount that goes to landfill?Many people won't fill the bins in 3 weeks - even when there was 5 of us here, we would have just about managed.
12	38268408	38267008	Factsaregood	0	17 July 2014 11:32am	They provide an additional smaller bin for Families- But that was because they cut down to fortnightly collections.We currently have four types of bins-Glass/plastic, paper, greenwaste/composting and black.
13	38269346	38267008	dianab	0	17 July 2014 11:51am	Thanks - reread and saw bit about families having extra bin for nappies etcWe have to pay for the garden/kitchen waste bin to be emptied fornightly - and it doesn't get emptied all round year so last lawn cut composts down in bin all winter and first lawn cut of the year joins it before being collected end of April. (some people fill bin with the end of year leaf fall) Cardboard goes in with the glass/plastic (fortnightly collection)People who don't pay the compostable waste charge put it all in their black bins so do fill that up more.We have space for compost bin for kitchen waste and some of the garden stuff like leaves.
14	38270623	38260242	Gladstone Minzie	2	17 July 2014 12:17pm	Expect Bury to be knee deep in rubbish by Christmas it's a lame brained Labour idea and before long it'll be once a month collections. I'm not sure what the rubbish collectors will be doing if there are any. We are moving back to the Middle Ages, expect plague and pestilence.
15	38272651	38260242	GO123	7	17 July 2014 12:56pm	Food waste is placed in the brown bin along with garden waste. The collection schedule of once every 2 weeks for food/garden waste (brown bins) is unchanged. So the change in collection schedule of the grey bin from 2 to 3 weeks doesn't have any impact on vermin. I appreciate that there may be trouble with households using disposable nappies but If they are sealed up properly and the bin is closed it shouldn't be a problem. Our neighbour used to throw lots of disposable nappies in our grey bin and they often sat there for 4 weeks with no issues. I regularly walk past lots of grey bins in the Bury region that are spilling over with recyclable material like glass bottles, paper and cardboard.  Part of the solution in raising recycling rates should focus on more education about what can be recycled and consideration of fines/rewards to encourage good attitudes to waste disposal for the minority who refuse to change their behaviour.

I appreciate the knowing tone in your post though, especially as it wasn't related to a thing I wrote.
17	38280237	38262916	mresta	0	17 July 2014 3:29pm	purpose built blocks maybe, we're in rows of converted terraces with wheelie bins on the pavement out the front as no one has places to put them.
18	38280303	38263723	mresta	0	17 July 2014 3:31pm	they do if the packaging once held things like bacon, for example. There might not be any food, but they'll still make a huge mess trying to find it.
19	38260316		megasox	53	17 July 2014 8:46am	Are they completely crazy? What do they want a new Plague?
20	38261738	38260316	SonOfTheDesert	39	17 July 2014 9:20am	Interesting how you suggest that someone else is completely crazy, and then talk about a new plague.
21	38262864	38261738	Iccleste	34	17 July 2014 9:43am	Do you think this is a good idea? We struggle with fortnightly collection. This is tantamount to a dereliction of duty. What are taxpayers paying for? I doubt anyone knew of this before casting their vote.
22	38263429	38260316	Dave C	8	17 July 2014 9:54am	As a resident of the borough I can confirm that they are.
23	38265315	38262864	alr1970	14	17 July 2014 10:32am	I think it is an excellent idea. We have fortnightly collection, and the bin is usually half full or less. 2 adults and 3 children. Even when we had 2 in disposable nappies it wasn't much fuller. We're in Manchester, so using the same service as Bury - GM has a single waste authority though individual boroughs use it differently. Food waste is collected weekly in summer, that's where all the smelly stuff goes, and a properly closed wheelie bin doesn't let much of a whiff escape anyway. Since 38 of the 51 council seats are held by Labour, it seems that people did vote for this. Does any party offer weekly collections?
24	38265761	38262864	SonOfTheDesert	5	17 July 2014 10:41am	I don't think it's a good idea. But I'm sane enough to understand that it won't cause a plague epidemic.
25	38265916	38265315	SonOfTheDesert	6	17 July 2014 10:44am	I'm intrigued by this. I live by myself, so clearly, my bin is going to be smaller than yours, but it's probably proportionate (if anything, I probably have more bin-space-per-person than your family). And I recycle everything I can possibly recycle, and make sure nothing slips through the net. Yet I almost fill my bin with food waste and the odd bit of unrecyclable packaging in a fortnight (although, as I buy most of my food fresh, there's not a lot of unrecyclable packaging). How are you keeping your bin so empty?
