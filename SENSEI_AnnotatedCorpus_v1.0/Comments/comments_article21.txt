1	37448669		musubi	71	26 June 2014 10:48am	Good news. Well done.
2	37453105	37448669	lierbag	19	26 June 2014 12:30pm	I'd suggest randomly inserting a tumour removed from a smoking related cancer patient into every thousandth pack, as possibly a better method of driving down sales.
3	37453878	37448669	retreat33	12	26 June 2014 12:47pm	Good news?  '...Said she would bring forward draft regulations by the end of [April]...This will finally happen on Thursday...there will be a further, short public consultation followed by negotiations with the EU...' To me that sounds like, 'we'll kick it back into the long grass and await some more substantial donations to OldCon party funds from the Baccy Barons.' Cynical of me? Yes, but I could never hope to emulate the cynicism of governments.
4	37454362	37453105	Monosyllabic	2	26 June 2014 12:57pm	Who says they actually want to drive sales down, everyone knows the risks what's your point?
5	37456366	37448669	jibber1975	1	26 June 2014 1:38pm	It's an open goal - retailers might sell crayons with them.
6	37457063	37448669	BWhale	8	26 June 2014 1:54pm	I can;t wait, the plain packaging looks so cool, and i think it will encourage people to return to the days of stylish cigarette tins. Much better than advertising a brand when you smoke.
7	37463087	37453105	mhmediaonline	0	26 June 2014 3:51pm	Unlucky Strike?
8	37467385	37448669	ManuelHung	5	26 June 2014 5:35pm	Do we still believe that people start smoking because of the packet? All that does is influence people into which brand they smoke, not whether they start smoking or not.  I think that they've made the cigarette box into an iconic item today. It's a plain white box ffs, you couldn't make it look cooler if you tried.
9	37477603	37448669	Shellfishbastard	0	26 June 2014 10:33pm	So how can us smokers know which is a B and H or a Marlboro now ? Does it come with a different photo of tumors related to the brand , so I can choose between the neck cancer or lung ? As Bill Hicks said , non smokers die every day , and if we want to control the population problem in the world , let people smoke , might do a favor to the NHS , if we're are really healthy it will become a burden in the long term seeing as they just want to get rid of us anyway .
10	37448746		Wassboy	29	26 June 2014 10:50am	Let's see - the tobacco lobby still has long tentacles.....
11	37449819	37448746	AlfalfaFFM	14	26 June 2014 11:16am	Maybe, but the industry has been fighting rearguard actions for decades now, with diminishing success (at least in Europe). It's been quite successful at delaying the inevitable, but ground lost hasn't been regained.
12	37456535	37449819	jdandi	3	26 June 2014 1:42pm	That seems to be the reason for the lobbying and delay tactics - Europe is about to nosedive Tobacco profits big time and the delay has meant that other profitable markets needed to be further established where governments were a bit more........lobbyable You look at Africa and Asia where the Tobacco Corps are thriving with little fear of government intervention and sadly, seemingly no voice from Euro/US governments to stop bad tobacco practice being 'offshored'! http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/22/tobacco-profits-deaths-6-million
13	37457122	37448746	BWhale	6	26 June 2014 1:55pm	I think the plain packets look very modern and cool actually. And i'm going to invest in a nice new cigarette tin and case. Much more stylish and individual than advertising a brand.

15	37462412	37457966	BWhale	5	26 June 2014 3:39pm	<blockquote>  Good for you. We still need existing smokers to keep paying all that lovely duty then die early before they can take too much pension. </blockquote>  What a sinister reply.  Its typical attitude of the health fascists to respond in such an awful way when claiming to 'care' about people's health they simultaneously wish death on those who disagree with them. You literally want me to die and not claim my pension so you can use my tax pounds i have spent *only* because i wish to live in way you disagree with. Its in this desire you've just revealed for my fate, instrumentalising other human beings for or against whatever cause you are currently obsessed with, that earns you the deserved name of health fascist. Instrumentalising human beings for your own ends is very sinister. Camus called people like you Humanists without humanity. Awful people.
16	37467880	37448746	Deebles	1	26 June 2014 5:52pm	I think the tobacco lobby are finally giving up on Britain as a market, as also evidenced by the recent closure of the last cigarette factory in Britain. A 1/3 drop in the UK's cigarette sales between 2002 and 2012 (according to the industry's figures, anyway) may be partly responsible.
17	37467992	37457122	Deebles	3	26 June 2014 5:56pm	You're not really the target for measures taken to deglamorize tobacco as a product, though: new smokers are. And the data from Australia point to a drop in sales after this measure, which, alongside the industry trying to block it wherever it's been suggested, rather suggests it might be a good idea.
18	37469556	37462412	TonightsTheNight	2	26 June 2014 6:55pm	You're the divvy who thinks cigarettes can look cool.
19	37469937	37456535	Zamindar	0	26 June 2014 7:08pm	I spend a lot of time in Africa and am surprised by how few people smoke.
20	37473910	37469937	Deebles	1	26 June 2014 8:45pm	I did too, albeit mostly in just one country, and I'd agree with you from my experience. However, it seems that there's a rising trend, with tobacco consumption increasing by 4% a year across Africa. http://www.atcri.org/en/index.php/news/37-special-report-smoking-in-africa-the-business-the-culture-the-risk
21	37448833		LoPann	79	26 June 2014 10:52am	I tend to find i buy tobacco for how it smokes not the packet it comes in. Just another waste of money by the government pretending they care about your health while all the time allowing diesel to be burned in cars knowing that it's diesel that is causing lung cancer.
22	37449105	37448833	MrsBertBibby	113	26 June 2014 10:59am	But if that's true, then the manufacturers have nothing to fear, as the marvellousness of their product will burn through, regardless of what it is sold in.
23	37449402	37448833	kimorris	38	26 June 2014 11:06am	Diesel from 10 or 20 years ago yes not anymore. I drive a diesel it is exempt from the congestion charge and emits less co2 than many petrol cars. Check the facts.
24	37449630	37448833	Ezra85	44	26 June 2014 11:12am	knowing that it's diesel that is causing lung cancer. Do you work for a tobacco company? There is plenty of evidence which supports cigarettes being one the main causes of various lung diseases, including lung cancer.
25	37449667	37448833	Barry841	35	26 June 2014 11:13am	Well, you might not understand it, but the tobacco companies certainly do, which is why they've fought so hard against plain packaging.
26	37450030	37448833	GoldenPath	20	26 June 2014 11:21am	What has this got to do with why you buy tobacco? You're smoking to fulfill the nicotine addiction and whatever other needs it fulfills. This is just one more thing to make cigs less appealing to kids in the first place.
27	37450082	37448833	JimNolan	30	26 June 2014 11:22am	<blockquote>  Just another waste of money by the government... </blockquote>  Legislators aren't on zero-hours contracts, you know. They get paid the same whether they're passing socially-useful legislation or not. Or did you think the government is offering to package the tobacco companies' products in plain boxes at taxpayer expense?
28	37450152	37449402	dogpresent	30	26 June 2014 11:24am	CO2 isn't directly damaging to human health, PM and NOx (emitted by diesel vehicles) are. I'm happy you enjoy your diesel car, but don't believe that recent improvements in diesel quality make its emissions clean. It's obvious that ciggs are worse for you than London air, but Londoners don't have a choice about breathing the air.
29	37450793	37449402	demagogue8	15	26 June 2014 11:38am	<blockquote>  Diesel from 10 or 20 years ago yes not anymore. I drive a diesel it is exempt from the congestion charge and emits less co2 than many petrol cars. Check the facts. </blockquote>  I don't think it is the CO2 that gives you lung cancer. It is harmless. Check you facts
30	37450848	37449105	CordwainerBird	3	26 June 2014 11:39am	<blockquote>  But if that's true, then the manufacturers have nothing to fear, as the marvellousness of their product will burn through, regardless of what it is sold in. </blockquote>... and indeed that may be the case. However the concern is that instead of working, or not working, it may actually result in a small increase in smoking and there is (highly disputed) evidence that may be the case.  <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/18/australian-medical-association-accuses-the-australian-of-promoting-smoking" rel="nofollow">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/18/australian-medical-association-accuses-the-australian-of-promoting-smoking</a> All this is just tinkering around the edges. The single biggest factor in people giving up smoking, or cutting down, is price. If the government is serious about reducing smoking they should be increasing the tax. Smugglers and trips to France simply could not compete with the demand generated if a packet of 20 was priced at Â£20. People would smoke less, many would stop. I speak from experience. I used to smoke. Before I gave up completely the only time I stopped was when I was unemployed and couldn't afford anything better than Drum.
31	37451775	37448833	Gnoway	9	26 June 2014 11:59am	But it keeps the spiteful ones happy. Hasn't smoking increased in Australia since it was introduced? Same people are no doubt happy to add to the alcohol related damage figures and will be squealing for liver transplants shortly at vast taxpayer expense without having paid the taxes smokers did. Will be so nice watching all non-smokers taxes rise to cover the nhs for their disgusting habits - street vomiters all.
32	37454149	37451775	retreat33	19	26 June 2014 12:52pm	'Hasn't smoking in Australia increased...?' No, not according to any independent statistics. Instead, it's reduced.
33	37454306	37449402	Nick321	8	26 June 2014 12:56pm	<blockquote>  Diesel from 10 or 20 years ago yes not anymore. I drive a diesel it is exempt from the congestion charge and emits less co2 than many petrol cars. Check the facts. </blockquote>  It's not the CO2 that's carcinogenic you dunce: it's the particulates and NOX. Check the facts...
34	37454347	37449105	Turnbull2000	13	26 June 2014 12:57pm	<blockquote>  But if that's true, then the manufacturers have nothing to fear, as the marvellousness of their product will burn through, regardless of what it is sold in. </blockquote>  Jesus christ, not that stupid argument again. This is about brand separation, not overall consumption. You think Coca-Cola and Pepsi would be content to see branding removed from their cans, so long as overall consumption accross all cola brands remains stable? People will just start consuming more of the cheaper cola products. The same outcome is likely with tobacco.
35	37454570	37451775	Abertawe	9	26 June 2014 1:01pm	Sales of tobacco per person in Australia have continued to decline since plain packaging was introduced. See the Guardian's own <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/datablog/2014/jun/06/is-smoking-increasing-in-australia" rel="nofollow">Datablog</a> for details.
36	37454822	37448833	kmanley	1	26 June 2014 1:06pm	That's what you think...
37	37454983	37448833	Jane Smith	5	26 June 2014 1:10pm	Not heard of the diesel filter all cars must have?
38	37455184	37450848	dessiato	3	26 June 2014 1:14pm	If cigarettes go up to &#163;20 a packet it would encourage smuggling, surely? I, for example, am a smoker. I live in Spain. This month I'm going to the UK for a month. I am taking enough cigarettes for the month. Colleagues of mine who don't smoke will take several cartons to sell. They can make enough profit to pay for the trip. Making cigarettes more expensive will encourage them, not discourage them at all.
39	37455644	37454347	austerlitz1311	3	26 June 2014 1:24pm	Exactly. Cigarettes are attractive in and of themselves. It's not the packaging that convinces people to start. Many won't even be aware of which brand of fags they first tried. The packaging is intended to differentiate between brands.
40	37456364	37449105	RichardManchester	2	26 June 2014 1:38pm	They have the fear of existing smokers not choosing their product/switiching brands as they can't identify the difference visually. That's a completely different issue to people choosing to start to smoke because there is some kind of branding on the pack. So it's about market share.
41	37464922	37451775	LordBile	3	26 June 2014 4:29pm	No it hasn't, it's decreased...The Australian (Murdoch rag) ran a story saying it had increased but was then found out to be using the wrong data (http://thekouk.com/blog/the-abs-confirms-tobacco-consumption-is-falling.html#.U6w8JMtZo_w)..

42	37466854	37449630	LoPann	1	26 June 2014 5:17pm	the main cause of cancer is wheat but i guess you won't know anything about that.

44	37467705	37449630	tiredgiraffe	4	26 June 2014 5:46pm	My mother, otherwise perfectly intelligent, is adamant that the asthma all her children suffer from was caused by artificial addictives in orange squash. Apparently she read it somewhere. She has a scientific background. Both she and her husband smoked very heavily for years (he still does) but apparently this had nothing at all to do with the development of asthma. Denial is a wondrous thing. So is clean air.
45	37468300	37449402	Chalcedon	2	26 June 2014 6:07pm	CO2 isn't the problem with diesel emissions, it's the tiny, lung penetrating particulates that are the problem. They cause irritation, can lead to COPD and thence cancer.
46	37470922	37468300	Deebles	1	26 June 2014 7:31pm	Yeah, yeah, you can try all the whattabouttery you like visavis diesel fumes, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency and other rare causes, but the fact is that 80-90% of COPD cases are caused by smoking. http://www.lung.org/lung-disease/copd/about-copd/understanding-copd.html
47	37472692	37455184	CordwainerBird	0	26 June 2014 8:15pm	Agreed, it would encourage smuggling. But no matter how much smuggling takes place you cannot smuggle enough into the UK to support anything like its current cigarette consumption. You can hide enough heroin in the body of a car to support hundreds of users for a year. To do that with cigarettes you would need a supertanker. The aim here is not to reduce smoking to zero. It's to reduce if as much as is reasonably possible. So if there is smuggling, then so what? Nobody is going to acquire a 20 a day habit for 50 years of his adult life on smuggled tobacco. It simply won't be possible.
48	37477815	37466854	Ezra85	0	26 June 2014 10:41pm	It depends on the type of cancer, but I guess you wouldn't know about that? For example wheat is associated with stomach cancer and smoking with lung cancer. It also depends on the country you live which be can affected by a number of different factors, including lifestyle.  I only lost my grandfather and uncle to lung cancer, 2 heavy smokers, but I guess I know nothing about smokings effect on people?

54	37449582	37449258	liberalfeatures	5	26 June 2014 11:10am	Ridiculous fannying around by the government in each direction. Either reject the plain packets outright or get on with introducing them tout suite with no more pandering to the tobacco industry. Clear and consistent.
55	37452597	37449582	alexiram	3	26 June 2014 12:18pm	So you're in favour of plain packaging? I don't think that's clear from your initial comment. I should imagine some of those Recommends are from people thinking you're saying the government is interfering in their lives
56	37455087	37448858	yeahboy	3	26 June 2014 1:12pm	If Australia is the only country to have introduced this measure in to date, then the fact the UK are well on the path to do so too is surely a good thing and not particularly indicative of "fannying around". Credit where it's due.

66	37450335	37448919	JimNolan	3	26 June 2014 11:28am	That phrase "more draconian than boarding school" reminded me of this (from Inside The Whale):  <blockquote>  Mr Connolly ends by remarking:  <blockquote>        Were I to deduce anything from my feelings on leaving Eton, it might be called The Theory of Permanent Adolescence. It is the theory that the experiences undergone by boys at the great public schools are so intense as to dominate their lives and to arrest their development.    </blockquote>    When you read the second sentence in this passage, your natural impulse is to look for the misprint. Presumably there is a 'not' left out, or something. But no, not a bit of it! He means it! And what is more, he is merely speaking the truth, in an inverted fashion. 'Cultured' middle-class life has reached a depth of softness at which a public-school education - five years in a lukewarm bath of snobbery - can actually be looked back upon as an eventful period.  </blockquote>

But for example I read the other day that the oldest person in the UK puts down his longevity to a regular drink and smoke. Many things are bad for you. Not all doctors talk sense. Life is a crazy place- some of us just want to live in peace.
83	37527926	37477171	oliveblaksmith	0	28 June 2014 9:13am	And no one is stopping you smoking. You just have to get used to not having a pretty coloured packet.
84	37449248		balancedman	9	26 June 2014 11:02am	It's a welcome step and a plain interior of air would be a giant leap.

86	37453965	37452577	birtland	8	26 June 2014 12:48pm	Absolutely! We live on the Vegas del Genil, just east of Granada, and very fertile. I would estimate that about 20% of the crop being grown at the moment is tobacco, and, I assume in receipt of EU subsidies.
87	37468231	37453965	Deebles	3	26 June 2014 6:04pm	Agricultural subsidies for tobacco are stupid on many levels. It also doesn't help that it's a crop that tends to receive a shitload of pesticides etc.

89	37449253		Oysterhead	39	26 June 2014 11:02am	McDonalds is a killer product and it is misleading for it to be presented in glitzy packaging. Every day of delay allows the fast food industry to tempt more young people into adopting a deadly habit. If we're going to continue to baby the nation then lets go down this road with everything?
90	37449809	37449253	MammysLittleSoldier	57	26 June 2014 11:16am	Having McDonalds now and again is fine - even fast food has nutritional value. There are no circumstance in which smoking tabs is anything but bad for you... ...and I know some people really really like burgers but I don't think many of them have 20 a day.
91	37449820	37449253	GoldenPath	38	26 June 2014 11:16am	They're not comparable, Maccie Ds isn't a killer product and it doesn't kill half of its customers. Someone who ate a McDonalds burger every day but who exercised and still got the full quota of fruit and veg would unlikely be doing themselves long term damage, wheras half of smokers who smoke an average amount of tobacco will die from it.
92	37453749	37449253	wobwobwobwob	4	26 June 2014 12:44pm	You haven't been to a macdonalds in quite a while have you? Glitzy packaging?
93	37454688	37449253	Alderbaran	3	26 June 2014 1:03pm	'Baby the nation'? Have you any idea how large the advertising industry is in this country and have you any idea of how much the Tobacco industry spend on advertising? Sure big food needs to be tackled but shouldn't we allow the public to come to their own conclusions in an environment unpolluted by the mixed messages conjured by marketers? The tobacco industry has been especially cynical in this regard and to see the introduction of plain packaging as 'Babying' is to misunderstand the relationship between the tobacco industry and its hosts.

I'm not going to suggest it should be the medicine of choice for anything, but it can potentially be used to alleviate a number of ailments. Just out of curiosity, why would you make such a bold statement?
95	37455835	37455376	tryingtobehonest	1	26 June 2014 1:27pm	Marijuana helps (in some cases) to alleviate the symptoms of multiple sclerosis.
96	37455942	37455376	MammysLittleSoldier	5	26 June 2014 1:29pm	Give us an example then...and example of a medicinal benefit of smoking a tab.
97	37456261	37455376	ID9432904	5	26 June 2014 1:36pm	it would have been useful if you had listed the medicinal properties. Just out of curiosity, what are they????
98	37459013	37456261	MammysLittleSoldier	2	26 June 2014 2:36pm	I've looked it up - I thought I better had - I think the chap will be back There's a bunch of stuff online discussing work that suggests smoking cigarettes may help prevent a small number of conditions...Parkinson's disease, for example. I immediately thought (despite being an ignorant fool)...but is there a net benefit? I.e smoking tabs may reduce the risk of a particular condition but all of the other risks associated with it remain. Unscientific googling suggests the sensible consensus is that smoking is still bad for you.  I mean there may be cases where you're dying of something and the benefit of having a tab outweighs the risk... but I think it's somewhat pedantic of the bloke to pull me up on it. We're talking about commercially available cigarettes (and their marketing)...that's clear in the article and clear from my use of the North East England colloquialism "smoking tabs".
99	37462478	37449820	ID6808231	6	26 June 2014 3:40pm	Life kills all of it's customers. Smokers, non-smokers, veggies, Mc Ds eaters. But the general agenda seems to be, we must try and get everyone to live to 105 and die peacefully in their sleep of old age. Ludicrous really.
100	37467526	37462478	mitch666	4	26 June 2014 5:40pm	Have you ever seen someone die of lung cancer? It ain't a pretty way to go. I'm sure everyone is aware that we're all going to die but it seems insane to choose such a nasty death.  I smoked for years, finally giving up about 3 years ago; I've got COPD, fortunately not too badly but it still interferes with my life and I'm not out of the woods on the cancer threat either.  It's all about living as well as possible before you die; there's a lot that can't be avoided but filling your lungs with toxic shit can be avoided. Starting smoking is the one and only regret that I have.
101	37468040	37449253	tiredgiraffe	2	26 June 2014 5:57pm	Yes, but when you eat a MacDonalds meal, you don't seriously affect the health of those around you. Smokers do. It's not just lung problems - passive smoking causes harm to foetal development, and is a major cause of childhood hearing loss. Living in a smoky environment causes severe wax buildup in the ears of small children, leading to grommet operations that would otherwise be completely unnecessary.
102	37468344	37468040	Deebles	1	26 June 2014 6:08pm	It's also worth noting that asthma attacks and deaths from asthma attacks tend to drop sharply after public smoking bans.
