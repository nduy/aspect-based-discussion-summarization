1	38237298		caxixi	36	16 July 2014 4:14pm	It is 4pm and I am in Portugal, 35 degrees outside, writing this in a house with all the shutters down. It is lovely and cool. At night I use a (ceiling) fan if necessary. I have lunch early and then a siesta from about 1pm to 3pm. After that, I continue working (computer) until about 8pm. In my experience, we English go wrong in that we OPEN rather than shut the windows/curtains. English friends came here last weekend and the first they asked was "do we have to sit in the dark in the middle of the day?". Answer, yes!

3	38259677	38237298	SamGamgee	6	17 July 2014 8:28am	So you are saying we should move to Portugal? 
4	38259930	38237298	bbmatt	15	17 July 2014 8:35am	Exactly this. I lived in South Africa for 20 years, we'd have temperatures topping 35c for weeks on end. The houses there are designed to cope - stone floors, mostly single storey. Lots of air flow.  Also, wear light cotton clothing that covers arms and legs when outside. Wear a hat & sandals.  It always amuses me to see men wearing trainers, no shirt & no hat outside in the heat - that just makes you hotter. And women wearing jeans - crazy. Why do you think people who live in hot countries don't dress that way? Move slowly, take everything really easy. 
5	38260164	38240638	timtim1	8	17 July 2014 8:42am	"shutters down""dark in the middle of the day?".  The shutters are the key I suspect. Unknown in the UK. Shutters closed and windows closed works because the sun's energy stays outside. The space behind the shutters warms up and this causes a convective flow of air through the space preventing further warming much above the air temperature. Curtains closed is not nearly so good because the sun's energy is already inside. Might be worth a try though.

7	38260463	38260164	Trebor1975	2	17 July 2014 8:50am	Closing the curtains definitely helps. The key is to do it before the sun comes around.

9	38264471	38237298	kizbot	4	17 July 2014 10:15am	Here in Greece.. In the morning, I shut the shutters, shut the windows and pull the curtains across to insulate the house from the heat. When it's dark I open everything in the house.. windows, balcony doors, the lot, to get as much cool air in as possible.I also sleep on the balcony.I have frequent cool showers as well when it's very hot 
10	38264569	38237298	kizbot	1	17 July 2014 10:17am	And I absolutely never ever sit in the sun.. I am always under an umbrella or under a tree.

17	38238794		BaronGrovelville	11	16 July 2014 4:50pm	I was working in the south of France during the 2003 heatwave and I would wear a hat which I kept soaked in water while at work, lie in a bath full of cold water before going to bed to get my body temperature down and drink gallons of water through out the day and before going to bed. My thermometer only went up to 50 degrees centigrade so I don't know how hot it was during the day but at 3 in the morning it was 32 degrees centigrade. I also avoided alcohol. It was hot. 
18	38261557	38238794	cerinamroth	3	17 July 2014 9:16am	Eugh, la canicule! I had to write my dissertation in that, and I can tell you that none of the minor dignitaries I had to interview could have given a rat's ass about the issues I was investigating - and I really couldn't blame them! I coped by only going out when I had to, keeping everything closed during the day, drinking lots of water, wearing loose clothes and only doing my writing at night. All common sense really. I was staying in a youth hostel with a naff foam mattress that seemed to bake me from the underside whenever I went to bed, so I got used to sleeping on the tiled floor. 
19	38261723	38238794	tarnarama	4	17 July 2014 9:19am	I agree that a cold/cold-ish bath or shower before bed works really well when it's very hot at night and you're struggling to cool down. And resist the temptation to open doors and windows to let in air if the house is cool, because you'll bring in warm air and warm the place up. 
20	38284221	38261557	BaronGrovelville	1	17 July 2014 5:18pm	Sleeping on a tiled floor! Yes I had forgotten that, me too! 
21	38239278		LeonRice	7	16 July 2014 5:02pm	What a pointless article. When it's warm drink cool drinks and shut the curtains. I always thought you should sit in direct sunlight at lunchtime if you wanted to cool down. Waste of column inches.

In these conditions, dogs die due to stupid owners leaving them in cars, people under-hydrate and pass out, wild-fires start due to fag ends on dry grass, all sorts of stuff happens. It depends where you are, but some of the UK is baking. 
28	38260014	38239724	bbmatt	3	17 July 2014 8:37am	It's not that hot *yet*  - it's going to get very uncomfortable & sticky in parts of England this evening and tomorrow. Thankfully the weekend will see a return to more moderate weather.

And they don't all think/behave/act/feel/experience things the same as you? Even with no sheets on my bed I'm struggling to sleep in the heat and am drenched in sweat. 
32	38271398	38239724	NinaRicky	1	17 July 2014 12:32pm	It depends whereabouts you are, surely? I'm just outside London and it's nudging 30 and mild/muggy at night. I'm currently sleeping mostly on top of my 4.5 tog duvet, and got the fan out last night...

34	38240743		teaandchocolate	12	16 July 2014 5:48pm	Close all your windows and curtains in the morning. Keep them closed till nightfall and get a fan. Eat liquorice. It can help to stop that dizzy feeling. Don't drink water on its own. Put a teaspoon of sugar in it. Eat more if you are walking or exercising. You could faint if your calories drop. Bananas are good. Wear natural loose fabrics and walk slowly all the time. 
35	38265550	38240743	tr1ck5t3r	1	17 July 2014 10:37am	I find just drinking water and fasting is best with high levels of Vit D > 200nmol/L although the latter will take 14days to achieve due to the supplements commonly taken needing to be processed by the liver and kidneys first before its activated. Having high levels of Vit D makes one feel the cold more in the winter but also tolerate the heat better in the summer which is somewhat ironic considering humans are most likely to generate it when UVB is highest.  The reduced chemical energy from not having to digest anything makes the heat more tolerable, and the lack of caffeine makes it easier to sleep especially when it can take upto 8 hrs in some people to clear from their system, smokers will clear caffeine more quickly.  Whilst caffeine can increase L-Dopa which increases dopamine which makes it possible to tolerate low level stress situations better, it can also raise ephedrine a stress hormone, especially if caffeine is consumed in a high enough quantity easily done today which then makes the stress from the high temperatures less tolerable. Alcohol & Caffeine both have similar effects. Sometimes adding a pinch of some sea salt (salt that is more than just sodium chloride) to a litre of water is also pleasant if one is sweating alot, but too much sodium chloride can make the T helper cell 17 start attacking the body which can then be diagnosed as an auto immune disease amongst other things and in high doses over a short period of time will make people sick. I'd never consume more than a teaspoon of salt in a day unless doing some serious exercise.  Keeping rooms dark help to keep out the solar energy thus reducing the greenhouse effect so to speak is good, but getting airflow is crucial once the building has reached an unacceptable temperature. If one has a loft, to help reduce the temp more quickly, open your loft hatch and let the heat escape from there, you will feel the blast of heat when you open it up otherwise that will radiate heat throughout the night into your bedrooms. Dont be scared to have all doors open either whilst up and around, but be secure when going to bed with doors and windows, burglars take advantage of people going to bed with windows open so a good CCTV camera can be useful if you dont mind GCHQ/NSA hacking it. Finally, if one looks at the temps, like for Heathrow http://www.weathercast.co.uk/world-weather/weather-stations/obsid/3772.html people can see the 11am temp is only lower from 22:00 onwards on hot days, so if possible it might be worth asking if one can go into work later and then go to bed later when the temp have become more tolerable for sleeping in the house.

37	38241542		Smyrna	14	16 July 2014 6:19pm	Advice from Turkey with a balmy 30c: In addition to the advice above regarding wearing loose fitting natural fabrics and closing windows and curtains during the heat of the day: Drink Ayran. Ayran is a salty yoghurt drink that may be an acquired taste but is fantastic in hot weather when food can seem unappetising but water alone is not enough. It's easy to make it yourself; mix natural yoghurt, water and a little salt. Afiyet olsun!

44	38242001		juliespetses	26	16 July 2014 6:34pm	Do as little exercise as possible. Do chores before 10 or after 8. If you have to walk, to the station for your commute, for example, plan to take twice as long to do it - walk slowly and stay in the shade as much as possible. (It can be between 5 and 10 degrees cooler in the shade.) Loose clothing, and not too much ;-) Iced drinks. Close curtains/blinds/shutters on the sunny side of the house; open them, and windows, in the part of the house that is in shade. Don't cook or use the oven.  At night, start with open windows and a fan aimed at the bed. If you still can't sleep, dampen a towel so it is wet but not dripping and lie underneath it, with or without the fan blowing air on to you. From Greece. We are forecast 36C at the weekend. 
45	38243230	38242001	caxixi	2	16 July 2014 7:22pm	I recommended you but it's hard not to cook, although I try to get everything done early in the morning and then just gently heat up if necessary. I also use an electric pressure cooker quite a lot. I agree about the oven though. Haven't used mine for months 
46	38247672	38243230	juliespetses	6	16 July 2014 9:57pm	Yes, it requires a bit of forward planning in terms of menus and getting any essential cooking done early in the day. Cook early, if you must, and cook enough for a few meals. If you must have the oven on (as I do, to make bread) make sure you maximise its use and cook other things as well - a quiche, roasted veg, chicken - that will do for subsequent meals and can e eaten cold. Warm up in microwave if you want hot food. (Or electric pressure cooker, as you say.) Or eat cold food. We have long hot summers in Greece and I try to cook no more than 3 times a week, including baking bread.

Open doors and windows during the cool night and then shut the house up during the day, the outside air is hotter than the inside and keeping widows open equalizes the heat inside the house. Major problem in UK is that houses do not have decent ventilation. Best solution, Get solar panels and use an air conditioner which is also a cheaper way of heating in winter.

Never leave a dog in a car, not even with windows open - it makes no difference to the temp. In 20 minutes the car is as hot as an oven. Take water with you for the dog, or leave the dog at home if doing an all-day walk in this heat. Someone recently killed a Newfoundland by taking it up the fell with no water on a hot day. Do your walks early and late. Thanks xx

Particularly when all your boys want to do is charge around and hide. You cant let them because the whole place is covered in dog shit. Utterly disgusting and utterly the fault of every dog owner. Still I wouldn't ban dogs from the beach I'd just ban dogs (and cats I'm not one of those cat obsessed people either), the world would be a very much nicer place.

89	38269846	38259515	foxinwinter	0	17 July 2014 12:01pm	are they allowed to breathe in and out? or only on alternate days? 
90	38269964	38265771	foxinwinter	3	17 July 2014 12:03pm	I could (if I were so minded) hate certain little boys. They yell and scream and drop litter and piss everywhere and... grow up to be small-minded people who have no tolerance, just like their mothers. The world would be a nicer place without them. 
91	38273269	38266196	Puss	0	17 July 2014 1:06pm	I did read the article. You're comment didn't specify that these activities were at certain times of the day. If you don't want any snarking, please be more specific.

I'm proud to say I have successfully lobbied to get an on the lead only restriction for dogs at a local open area. Some owners actually believed their dogs had as much right to run and play as children! 
93	38259294		PaulUK83	16	17 July 2014 8:17am	Just run your hands under the cold tap for a couple of minutes. Your hands are radiators of heat, because they have a huge surface area. Your core body temperature will cool doing this. Makes a big difference. 
94	38261948	38259294	wryneck201	16	17 July 2014 9:23am	Although it's better to cool your wrists, as this is where the blood passes through close to the surface. The cooled blood then continues around your body

96	38259510		SamGamgee	11	17 July 2014 8:23am	Don't leave your dog, cat or child in the car, even with the window down 'a little bit'. A car is an aluminuium oven cum greenhouse on a hot day and they dehydrate much faster than you think. 
97	38269690	38259510	andyinSpain	1	17 July 2014 11:58am	I don't think many people would do this whatever the weather, I am in fact shocked that people have to be reminded of something like this, truly shocked. 
98	38270113	38269690	foxinwinter	1	17 July 2014 12:07pm	people are still leaving their dogs in the car while they have lunch in the pub, or do supermarket shops. Luckily the Police allow you to break a window now, if they can't get there and the owner is absent. Prosecutions are few for the owners, but nonexistent for the window-breakers :) 
99	38271372	38269690	SamGamgee	1	17 July 2014 12:32pm	I would wish otherwise, but if we get a couple of days of 28 degrees+ then I bet we get a headline with exactly this story. Last year there was the police dog that died after being left in the van. And as the other poster said - leaving them in the car whilst in the pub. Its shameful.

101	38262505	38259680	Alex42	21	17 July 2014 9:35am	And once they've cooled down sufficiently, you can lick your pets.
