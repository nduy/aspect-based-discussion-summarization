1	37740814		madmonty	38	03 July 2014 5:38pm	The Private Eye has reported that George Osborne's cuts to the Environment agency has also reduced the agencies ability to provide close monitoring of fracking wells. On top of that our illustrious chancellor has allowed fracking companies to produce an environmental impact assessment after they have drilled a well?!? Water contamination in America has apparently occurred due to careless disposal of the fracking chemicals used, never mind the poisoning of underground aquifers during the fracking process. It speaks volumes that one of the directors of the biggest fracking company in the states doesn't want a fracking well anywhere near his own property, which doesn't builds trust that fracking is safe.

The answer is not to shut down industry or prevent the exploitation of new resources, but to ensure that proper regulation applies and that the job is done right. All and any oil or gas production COULD be done in a way that could create environmental havoc, The answer is to ensure that it is done right. Nearly all shale gas resources are extremely deep under ground, way below any ground water and as the article explains, mostly almost a kilometer below that level.There is no chance at all that cracks caused by fracking would go anywhere near. The danger zone is the well leading down to those deep levels. These vertical tubes need to be correctly lined with steel and concrete to prevent leakage as gas and oil gets near the surface. There is not a single oil or gas well in the world where this isn't an issue whether fracking is used or not, so the idea that we have a particular issue in fracking is balderdash and nonsense. The same risks apply to any hyrocarbon production and we have a long history of that in the UK and a good record.

12	37778083	37742076	Fernando Leanme	6	04 July 2014 4:27pm	You know, this is an excellent example of how to misrepresent the truth. The guy is suing to stop construction of a water tower intended to supply trucks used to bring water to well sites. In other words, it has nothing to do with fracking. It has to do with truck traffic and the consequences. And in this case the truck traffic is associated with clean water transport.  I've written over 20 posts here at the Guardian pointing out the "editorial line" used to attack fracking is ludicrous. Those of us who have to deal with this problem can point out the problem is caused by issues you never discuss. It's things such as the truck traffic, the busted roads, and the noise which lead to conflict. Where I own my Texas property we chose to impose local regulations on the oil and gas companies, to make them bypass the urban areas with their trucks, pay to fix the roads, and to put landscaping and noise abatement around their well sites. But we aren't super rich like the ExxonMobil guy. We wanted the royalty money and the cash.

It's okay for Rex to profit from fracking so long as the consequences aren't in his backyard.
14	37780408	37778583	Fernando Leanme	4	04 July 2014 5:53pm	Huh...there's no need to have a water tower built and water supply trucks in urban areas with expensive housing. You know, this is just common sense. Those landowners pay taxes according to the property appraisal, therefore the local tax district (whatever it is) should consider participating as amicus curiae in this particular litigation.  What we did where I lived and now rent is not too far from this guy's house (but I own a much cheaper property).  The approach taken was to regulate them and make them shift their practices to suit our aims, which were to make them pay taxes through their noses while at the same time driving our property prices up. This was achieved, and I believe it only took a couple of lawsuits to make them learn their lesson. And even though my particular property IS indeed gaining value, I'm still concerned over the landscaping they use to cover the walls we made them put around their well sites. They tend to be cheap and their flower bushes aren't well kept.

16	37835874	37782752	Fernando Leanme	2	06 July 2014 3:28pm	It's not a "fracking company". Such businesses supply water. I guess it's a bit too complex for some people to understand the legal and commercial structures. In general many enviromentalists aren't well acquainted with these topics, this is why they tend to be ineffective. It's what I call the ready fire aim syndrome.

19	37742366	37741800	Bangorstu	21	03 July 2014 6:25pm	It does depend on if the process is done properly. Some of those aquifers are 600m away from the shale..which should be fine.

Methane is not only non toxic, it is also insoluble in water.  Nevertheless that same spokesman blethered on about poison and was also trying to tell us that we would all be blown up in our beds. Not a hint of scepticism of such an unlikely event by the BBC interviewer, either. There may be many reasons why fracking in GB may turn out not to be a good idea...but the sheer scale of breathtaking alarmism and well...just plain lying...by the anti-frack brigade is remarkable.  Still...they would appear to be winning. Just as well the shale gas will still be there when we frack it eventually. They cannot make it disapppear, much as they would like to.

23	37748470	37741800	oakwood	11	03 July 2014 10:03pm	By far, the biggest threat to your water well is pollution from the surface or near surface activities. Where does your waste water go, or that of your neighbours? If it goes to a septic tank with overflow (which is very common in rural areas), this represents a much much larger risk than deep shale fracking.  Also, how is your well protected? Is it protected from the risk of the pooh from rats, mice, livestock, birds, being washed into it by heavy rains? Does it have a filter to protect it from airborne microbes (which any good drinking wate well should have)? Is your water filtered and disinfected? Do you store it in tanks before drinking? These are all much greater risks.
24	37750710	37746931	Bangorstu	7	03 July 2014 11:24pm	Assertion without evidence. The Royal Society (who one assumes knows what it's talking about) says differently. Perhaps we need a test site to demonstrate the process?  Or are the anti-technology trustifarians scared they might be proven wrong?

36	37742521		Boodicca	31	03 July 2014 6:30pm	It really is totally irrelevant how deep an aquifer is. It is also irrelevant how deep the shale is. What is HIGHLY relevant is the fact that the wells pass THROUGH the aquifers to access the shale. All cement, concrete & even steel rots in time, especially if it passes through water..... so no matter how much care is taken the aquifers WILL become contaminated with migrating gases & frack fluids. The Protector community has been warning for years about these obvious & logical facts. Now, today, we hear that Unite is backing us in our battle to ban fracking. We can hardly express our delight to have 1.5 million trade unionists on our side!:)

43	37748602	37742521	oakwood	9	03 July 2014 10:08pm	Almost all industrial activities present a risk to groundwater if not properly regulated and managed. Regarding underground activities, that includes tunnelling (road, rail), oil wells, conventional gas wells, sewage networks, building foundations and basements, underground car parks, petrol station storage tanks, etc, etc. If we can manage these, why assume we can't manage fracking wells? Is it you are just gullible?
44	37751483	37743089	Walsunda	2	03 July 2014 11:59pm	In Queensland's Great Artesian Basin water in the sandstone aquifers at depth makes its way up the bore to the surface in many places without pumping by windmills due to hydraulic pressure; which in simplistic terms is simply water finding its own level with the assistance of gravity: the intake area for the basin being at a higher elevation in the eastern highlands than the land surface up to a thousand kilometres to the west.
45	37758610	37743089	itchyvet	4	04 July 2014 7:34am	As already stated, fracking fluid is only partly removed from wells.Question is, how is that fluid disposed of ? In the states they have tried evaporation ponds, which quickly killed birds who mistook it for water. When dried up the remaining chemicals were spread about by wind in dust storms contaminating everything it came into contact with, making sick and even killing livestock, sterilizing agricultural land, AND contamination fresh surface water when the contaminated dust settled in same.They then tried injecting this fluid into underground cavities of various natures, and all of a sudden we saw earthquakes occurring in states that have never had an earth quake.C'mon people, do your own homework, there's plenty of evidence readily available to prove to anyone, (who is not a share holder in a fracking company, this procedure is very dangerous for our environment indeed.) this fracking business is a dire threat to us all.Oh, by the way, check also how many wells fracked in the U.S. failed inspections by their own E.P.A. and leaked contaminants into the ground via CRACKS in the concrete bore sides.

48	37778350	37743089	AfterOil	3	04 July 2014 4:35pm	After holes in the horizontal pipe are formed by a "necklace" of shaped charges, fracking fluids are injected using a chain of high pressure pumps at 100 MPa (15,000 psi in obsolete units) to open fissures in the shale. The fluid contains chemicals including HCl which forms soluble salts with toxic metals (including radium and uranium) while the fissures are kept open to release the gas with sand or resins(Proppants) At these high pressures toxins can readily rise up enlongated fissures to contaminate aquifers.
49	37778758	37742521	Fernando Leanme	5	04 July 2014 4:48pm	They don't use concrete. If I may explain.... ......the well starts with a short piece of pipe put into the ground. The space between the pipe and the ground (the annulus) is filled with cement.  .....Once that first batch of cement is set, they clean the inside of the steel pipe, and a smaller hole is drilled through the pipe, and on through the rocks below. Depending on the local geology and the final well objective, this smaller hole is drilled several hundred meters into the rocks. The idea is to make sure all the fresh water aquifers have been penetrated. Then another piece of steel pipe is introduced, and cement is placed between the rocks and the steel pipe (the annulus).  ....once the cement is hard they repeat the process, and another hole is drilled through the second pipe and on through the rocks below. This may be the last hole they drill, when they finish drilling they place another pipe in that hole, which runs all the way back to the surface, and place cement in the annulus.  The idea is to have two pieces of pipe with their respective cement sheaths between the inside of the well and the fresh water aquifers.  Once the well is drilled, the steel pipes are set in cement, the cement is hard, the cement quality has been checked with special tools, then they put holes in the final pipe's section they think is penetrating gas bearing rocks.  The high pressure fluids are pumped through these holes to fracture the rocks in the are near where the holes were created. There are other details I can't explain, but the eventual design should have three pieces of steel pipe between the gas flowing up the hole and the fresh water aquifer. Two of those steel pipes will be surrounded by special cement.  It is true that sometimes the cement doesn't have a perfect seal, this in turn is checked with tools and also by monitoring the pressure in the well annulus (a leak up the annulus shows as a pressure build at the annulus seal unit at the surface).

56	37760391	37757575	buddingBuddha	3	04 July 2014 8:41am	Did I suggest anything like that? I was suggesting that "CO2 is plant food so it cannot possibly cause problems" is a nice slogan but it is so plainly specious that whoever says it is either a fool or a knave. Things are a bit more complicated than that. Plants need CO2, water (not too much, not too little), light, warmth (not too much, not too little), nutrients (not too much, not too little) and a miriad of other things. You say you are a scientist so you do not need to be told that an excess CO2 in the atmosphere causes a lot of trouble. I understood you said that "CO2 is plant food so it cannot possibly cause problems" is the best argument contrarians have. In that case, contrarians have no argument whatsoever. The atmosphere on Venus is almost completely composed of CO2. Plants don't love it. As to fracking, I don't agree with it. Granted, it's probably better than coal but that's not saying much: being hit by a car is better than being hit by a truck. More importantly, it just propagates the fossil-fuel model, the growth paradigm, the cake now and fuck later ideology. It's a road ending in tears.

However I have to point out, you seem to have your denier memes mixed up. <a href="http://www.woodfortrees.org/plot/gistemp/from:1999/to:2015/plot/gistemp/from:1999/to:2015/trend" rel="nofollow">As this clearly shows. </a> It is not 1999 but 1998 you are supposed to seeth about, the strongest el Nino ever recorded.Yes the proof there is no warming as that we are now as warm as a super el Nino of only 16 year ago.  Please keep contributing with your fun filled facts.
59	37779034	37772792	Fernando Leanme	4	04 July 2014 4:57pm	Actually we aren't as warm this year as in 1998.  However, why can't we all get along? After all we're debating over 5/100ths to 1/10th of a degree centigrade, as well as which reference we use, and where we start measuring with those pesky rulers and graph inclinometers.  For example, here where I live in Spain the temperature has been dropping over the last 10 years. However, if we use the whole Northern Hemisphere (like the controversial Michael Mann did in "False Hope"), then we can conclude it's going up. But if we point out the region that's really increasing a lot is poleward of 60 degrees north latitude then the Norwegians and Alaskans may shout with glee and thank those warmer days they are seeing.  So I guess it's all relative to which ruler you use. I like to look at the total system energy. That one seems to be going up slightly, but the rate of increase sure has me stumped, its much lower than the figures I see published by the IPCC. Which makes me wonder why they don't come close to agreement. I'm working on that.

We usually associate stories on fracking that appear in the Guardian with green-ideologically motivated anti-fracking scaremongering, not the reporting of rational risk assessments by bodies that know what they are talking about like the BGS. Let's hope that the UK now moves full speed ahead with fracking, as the quickest way of cutting CO2 emissions and retiring our aging fleet of 1960s and 70s fleet of coal fired power stations as cheaper gas prices reopen the mothballed gas fired plant.
64	37743098	37742750	ratherbered	11	03 July 2014 6:51pm	You are clearly a fracking supporter despite the strong and incontrovertible evidence form the States that fracking is a South Sea Bubble, Dutch Tulip bubble, Dot com bubble and sub-prime loan scandal now unraveling.Fracking will be an enormous vote loser for the Tories - surprised that they can't see this. How many Poll Tax car crashes does it take to make the idiots who govern us wake up and deal with the real issues rather than clutching at magic bullets that simply don't exist.
65	37743776	37743098	jsw2011	7	03 July 2014 7:15pm	Fracking in the US is the "magic bullet" that is closing dozens of their old banger coal fired power stations.  For the sake of the environment, the same process cannot happen too soon in the UK.

68	37747728	37742750	Helen Chuntso	8	03 July 2014 9:36pm	perhaps you need to be in touch with the reality of methane emissions from fracking.Perhaps you need to be aware of the reality that all our needs can be met from renewable energy without the need for the myth of bridging fuel form fracking, if only the billions of pounds of tax breaks for dirty fossil fuels were stopped and planning control was to permit large scale renewables withou Eric Pickles interferring from his own agenda.This is addiction to fossil fuels and your masters are spinning us all a junkies tale which is crumbling like the pack of cards it is.

71	37751702	37742750	Walsunda	0	04 July 2014 12:09am	Supply and demand economics mean that despite rapidly rising supply of gas ( by shale fracking in Britain and coal seam extraction in Queensland) demand is still rapidly outstripping supply (as export through pipes lines to the east in Britain and by bulk gas carriers in Queensland) such that the cost of gas precludes it's use for electricity generation. In the US the absence of export infrastructure ensures a closed market so the price of gas is roughly half that of the rest of the world.   In Australia gas was cheap but with the pipelines and terminals ready to go on line this December prices are already skyrocketing
72	37751801	37743776	Walsunda	1	04 July 2014 12:15am	In Queensland the rising price of gas as the local gas supply burgeons and is readied for export on the open market has closed the one relatively new gas power station at Swanbank in favour of expansion of expansion of the existing coal fired power station at Tarong.
73	37752351	37743098	ColinMay	4	04 July 2014 12:44am	Fracking in N Dakota is not a 'South Sea Bubble'. Money is pouring into State coffers and a state rainy day fund. And the light crude is sold into US and Canadian markets.

But the ones about natural gas not making money are just the result of a deep misunderstanding about how a commodity market works. In general this isn't a business for people with weak knees or shallow pockets. And this is why ex oilmen go to Houston Texas to sell belt buckles.
89	37804143	37742956	Stunning	9	05 July 2014 1:16pm	That's just pure jealousy, based on the fact that we in Europe, with our addiction to coal, Russian gas etc have achieved zero by any metric you choose.... The US, meanwhile, has decreased CO2 more than any other industrialised nation AND boosted its economy, all thanks to shale gas.
90	37743067		ID9876	22	03 July 2014 6:49pm	We shouldn't concentrate so much on depth of shale but worry more about well integrity. If they overlap, the gas has to be brought through that aquifer safely and if something goes wrong with the well casing then.... bye bye aquifer.

94	37744941	37743067	Geologybob	12	03 July 2014 7:58pm	By the time the gas is level with aquifers, it is travelling through the centre of at least 5 concentric alternating layers of steel and cement. Its very unlikely that all 5 (or more) seperately installed and cemented layers would simultaneously fail if things are done properly.  With the extra BGS info, it means higher risk areas can be identified and avoided or the risks mitigated by extra technical or legal requirements. Unlike the USA, the British Geological Survey have run and are continuing to run a survey of methane naturally present in our groundwater, so there will be far greater transparency to the process here with a reference baseline.  In the US, the US Geological Survey has conducted a survey in New York state which has maintained a moratorium on fracking. It found a lot of natural methane in the rivers and wells of New York state including many water wells which needed action or monitoring to prevent explosion. Maybe the residents of the adjoining state of Pennsylvania could have done with some baseline monitoring before their state was drilled.<a href="http://www.waterworld.com/articles/wwi/print/volume-27/issue-5/editorial-focus/groundwater-development-flow-modelling/new-york-new-yorks-dissolved-methane-concerns.html" rel="nofollow">Waterworld article reporting USGS reporton natural methane levels in NY</a>
95	37747611	37743613	NorthernGeneration	8	03 July 2014 9:33pm	Do you know anything about the UK's drinking water treatment processes? They absolutely WOULD NOT remove the types of pollution that would arise from a failed shale gas well.
96	37747881	37743613	Helen Chuntso	8	03 July 2014 9:41pm	You cannot remove ethylene glycol form contaminated water. You do not even knwo the full list of disclosed frack chemicals as they are commercially sensitive and are hiding form public scrutiny. You also cannot verify- as I have endeavoured to find the location of the NORM disposal faacilities (radioactive waste waste and drill cuttings) from the Environment Agency Do you know where the radioactive and waste dumps are I wonder? Where will the frack fluid go? I imagine when it is within 10 km of your house you will do your homework to remove your doubt.

Why do you think paracetomol has the quantity on the box, or do you take a whole box's worth when you get a headache? Oh that's right, you don't, because you'd possibly be dead and wouldn't be here pushing the fracking industry line.
99	37757823	37747881	PatLogan	8	04 July 2014 6:55am	<blockquote>  You cannot remove ethylene glycol form contaminated water. </blockquote>  amazing, then that glycol dessicant systems work as a closed loop...and that the chemical is such a threat that we use it routinely in volume in things like automotive anti-freeze. As to the NORM, would this be a reference to the tritium contaminated water at Barton? It's simple to dispose of - dilution. It's worth looking at what evidence there is of harm (or the lack of it) from tritium
100	37765342	37751827	Fumnx9vfmnx	4	04 July 2014 10:54am	President Obama says ". "Sometimes there are disputes about natural gas," he said at his climate change speech last week at Georgetown, "but let me say this: We should strengthen our position as the top natural gas producer because, in the medium term at least, it not only can provide safe, cheap power, but it can also help reduce our carbon emissions."Sometimes you greenies cannot see the wood for the trees.

I could make it kind of simple, with no math and just drawings I make with powerpoint and things like that, but it would go way beyond what you get in The Guardian. Do you think this would help you guys?
