1	37858764		lindalusardi	49	07 July 2014 9:50am	what about having a word with them about ticket prices aswell?
2	37859086	37858764	Cynic24	110	07 July 2014 9:59am	That would be fairly pointless, given that Network Rail don't operate passenger trains!
3	37859323	37858764	Cynic24	79	07 July 2014 10:06am	The fact that the first post is getting recommends shows that there are some clueless people out there! If you are going to criticise the railways (I do so fairly often), then at least read up on how they actually work! Criticising from from a position of complete ignorance won't gain you any credibility! Passenger trains are not operated by Network Rail (their remit is solely to maintain the railway infrastructure), therefore the ticket prices are nothing to do with them!
4	37860851	37859086	lindalusardi	33	07 July 2014 10:50am	silly me, of course I forgot that network rail provide their services to rail operators completely free and have nothing whatsoever to do with increasing ticket prices d'oh
5	37861582	37859323	martin77	9	07 July 2014 11:11am	OK so the lady made a mistake , calm down for Heavens sake.
6	37862703	37859086	Craig Axon	3	07 July 2014 11:42am	Average ticket prices are set by the government. The train company then as a leeway to increase or decrease the price from the average set. Ticket prices are determined not by distance, as such, but by the number of people travelling from one particular point to another and so forth. There's more to it but that's the gist of it. Also, most the money made by fares is invested back into the railway infrastructure, so it's a cycle. Only a small amount per £1 spent on a ticket goes to train company profits. Most goes to network rail, fuel, train maintenance, staff costs and so forth. It must also be noted that network rail is a not for profit company and many profits either get invested back into the railway or given to the government to find major projects like thameslink and crossrail. The railway is not very transparent which is the problem why most people vent their rage on train companies and network rail.
7	37863775	37861582	Beeron	1	07 July 2014 12:10pm	I wouldn't be too sure lindalusardi is a lady...
8	37867012	37858764	PrimitivePerson	3	07 July 2014 1:26pm	Network Rail don't have anything to do with ticket prices.
9	37868781	37860851	Cynic24	6	07 July 2014 2:05pm	Yes, silly you! The fact that operators pay a cost to Network Rail for track access is beside the point. NR's funding is all set by the government, and they (NR) have absolutely no say in ticket prices - those are set by the train operators within a framework of restrictions set by the government. If you want to complain about ticket prices (which is certainly a fair complaint in many cases) the people to complain to are the passenger operators and the government. To use another transport analogy, complaining to Network Rail about ticket prices would be like complaining to a dock company about the price of an electronic item which happened to be imported through their facilities.
10	37870749	37859323	Socialismaintdead	12	07 July 2014 2:57pm	Not really - it just shows how demented train privatisation is
11	37872719	37859323	C2H4n	2	07 July 2014 3:52pm	So as far as the TOCs are concerned, Network Rail operate in a vacuum & what it charges those companies for track space is not partly reflected in the fares charged?
12	37875011	37872719	Cynic24	1	07 July 2014 4:56pm	Only to the same extent that anything you buy will include its transport costs! But the original poster was suggesting complaining to Network Rail about ticket prices. A lot of people seem to have trouble understanding that this would be completely pointless as Network Rail have no influence over ticket prices. Is this really so difficult to understand?
13	37876421	37859323	mathnawi	6	07 July 2014 5:37pm	It is symptomatic of how ridiculously fractured our rail system is however. It isn't an unreasonable assumption to think the same company or institution was responsible for both fares and punctuality. Yesterday at St. Pancras I became alarmed when the last train to Canterbury didn't show on the national departure board - because I assumed that all national trains would be listed together for passenger convenience. But know separate companies had departures on desperate boards. Crazy. Choice is bullshit - passengers just want a reliable service. Bring back British Rail or something like it.

19	37858786		KeithClan	190	07 July 2014 9:50am	Don't we (the tax payers) own Network Rail? So how is fining ourselves going to help improve our disfunctional Railways? Nationalisation is the answer with rail prices aligned with those in most of Europe.
20	37858932	37858786	Deviant	23	07 July 2014 9:54am	Agree 100%.  The TOCs are hardly without fault, either. A bit of disaster recovery planning would do wonders.
21	37859667	37858786	hosede88	34	07 July 2014 10:16am	exactly - it is the directors who should be collectively fined - fat chance of that happening
22	37859715	37858786	thomo21	11	07 July 2014 10:17am	Yes we own it and it is more or less fully nationalised already with the process of brining their debts onto the Treasury's books being completed this September. This is not really the solution to any of the problems mentioned here though. The railway doesn't magically start working wonderfully just because someone else owns it. Fares have nothing to do with Network Rail or even much to do with private operators and are everything to do with the level of state support politicians or we as taxpayers are prepared to provide. It has been government policy for many years to reduce the burden on the taxpayer and we are now at the stage where passengers cover operational costs with the taxpayer paying for enhancements. Fining ourselves is somewhat ridiculous and the wifi roll-out is just a way of recycling money back into the industry in some way. At the root of the problem is a much busier railway than 20 years ago which makes it harder to recover from service disruption. British Rail heavily rationalised the network in the 60s, 70s and early 80s and we still live with the legacy of this. We've seen some attempt to fix this on East Coast with the new North Doncaster Chord and the Hitchin Flyover being completed recently. The latter was dreamt up at least 50 years ago. Great Western users are or soon will become aware of major improvements there too.

24	37860307	37858786	lierbag	9	07 July 2014 10:35am	It's hardly a 'slap' fining a company £50m, when it gets an annual public subsidy of £2.9bn.
25	37866120	37858786	Tim Eslip	20	07 July 2014 1:07pm	The fine is a way of withdrawing public funds funds from a public service so that it begins to fail and then privatisation can be presented as the only solution.
26	37868124	37859715	Speenhamland	15	07 July 2014 1:51pm	The rationalisation of BR in the 60s, 70s was part of the 'Modernisation of British Rail' programme under Super Mac's Conservative Govt (Marples/Dr Beeching). Any 'cuts' undertaken in the 1980s was due, almost entirely, to rail subsidy cuts by the Thatcher Government. Cuts designed to undermine BR, in an attempt to make future privatisation more attractive to the public. At one point BR even had to ask the Treasury for emergency funding to pay for the fuel for its diesel locomotives.I have a suspicion that, decades later, those who worship a similiar political icon may be considering that catch-all answer to every ill, infrastructure privatisation. Trouble is, some of us have vivid memories of what happened under Railtrack.
27	37868910	37866120	Cynic24	12	07 July 2014 2:09pm	They tried that before with the railway infrastructure. The privatised operator, Railtrack, was such an unmitigated disaster that it had to be renationalised!
28	37871367	37858786	printerink	2	07 July 2014 3:13pm	Stafford hospital is nationalised and it didn't stop all those deaths. The BBC is nationalised and it didn't stop Savile. And of course those organisations have not been fined £53 million either, even though deaths and child sex abuse are a bit more serious than late trains.
29	37872566	37871367	C2H4n	12	07 July 2014 3:48pm	Stafford hospital is nationalised and it didn't stop all those deaths. All those deaths? Haven't you been keeping up with this? The independent report scotched the Daily Mail's scaremongering report, still if it doesn't fit with your prejudices I don't suppose you will want to be convinced.
30	37878419	37858786	Bluestone	2	07 July 2014 6:43pm	Fining a public body who's ability to do a good job is dependent (partly) on how much money they have to do it, is counter-productive. Individuals in that public body are relatively uneffected by such fines, so it leaves me wondering exactly in what way is the fine supposed to induce greater effectiveness? But then I'd hardly be the first to question the intelligence of regulators or the people who set them and the mechanisms they operate with, up.
31	37883645	37872566	Orthus	3	07 July 2014 9:50pm	Wasting your time, I'm afraid. @printerink posts bollocks and will continue to do so, never reads replies.

34	37868947	37858937	Cynic24	9	07 July 2014 2:10pm	Network Rail are a non-profit public body, so they don't have any profits. Any income either gets ploughed back in to the rail network or goes to the government.

The "private" bit is a deliberate lie. Theres nothing private about it. The taxpayer owns it. The fine is meaningless, as it must get it back in public subsidy, or it ceases to function.

As regards the coalition view, the suspicious among us might think that it suits them as NR being fully a part of the civil service will make it easier for them to grind it down and cut funding, leading to performance issues which they could then use as an excuse to try flogging it off again.

A: See west country answer. How will this benefit the train operators and their shareholders? A: Another £53.1m of taxpayers money being loaded into their over laden troughs.

I assure you from my soul I earnestly congratulate you & your expanding business in Somerset.  I hope your seeking for suitable staff isn't due to logistic difficulties making working for your organisation impractical. Perhaps they're late because of unfortunate train delays outside the control of what your prospective job seekers. This problem can be rectified.  I live in this country with you, GeoffTr, & your prosperity is as important as the prosperity of everyone living with us. We may not share political affiliations but I do hope you & I have more in common than we don't.
87	37893599	37885286	GeoffTr	2	08 July 2014 8:08am	Only one of my businesses is in Somerset, the others are scattered around the country. I'm recruiting people because my businesses are growing & have no difficulty in doing so. For some reason my local JobCentre in Somerset (but not the others I deal with) thinks that people arriving late for an interview is OK. I've phoned them on several occasions to let them know that interviewees have not turned up (I understand that they may be sanctioned) or have arrived late. The JobCentre do not consider that being up to 30 minutes late is a problem. I've explained that anyone arriving even one minute late for an interview with me will not be seen but I just get a shrug.
88	37940864	37893599	citizenJA	0	09 July 2014 9:50am	I welcome your post & ask your pardon for not responding sooner.  <blockquote>  I'm recruiting people because my businesses are growing & have no difficulty in doing so. </blockquote> I congratulate you - I mean that sincerely - I meant it in my earlier post & now.  I don't have experience with JobCentre staff or the organisation. I'm therefore not able to give you counsel. It sounds as though you're doing what you should - communicating clearly with the JobCentre about your concerns.  My post to you was questioning whether or not public transportation tardiness or sporadic coverage may be part of the problem in the Somerset area.  It may be known by JobCentre staff this is the case & have made thirty minutes the length time a job seeker has before officially being called "late". Clearly, this is problematic for all concerned. The potential remoteness of your location at this work place may play a part - I don't know if your work place is remote. I'm taking the liberty of suggesting this example of why the policy is in place. Given the unprecedented number of sanctions levied onto job seekers at this time in history, in many cases due to matters totally outside the control of those wanting employment, I too am surprised at the response you've received from the Somerset JobCentre; I share your puzzlement.  You have work for people needing work - it's a tragedy if dysfunctional transportation systems are preventing employer & employee satisfaction. <blockquote>  I've explained that anyone arriving even one minute late for an interview with me will not be seen but I just get a shrug. </blockquote> GeoffTr, I respectfully suggest you're being too hard on potential staff who may benefit your organisation. Please consider tempering the one minute late & no interview with you rule currently in place. I understand your responsibilities as a businessperson are great. Your leadership may be scrupulous without being uncompromising.  Thank you for taking the time to post. I wish you & those working with you every lasting success.

Although Somerset is a largely rural county with rather poor public transport provision, my plant is actually close to a couple of good size towns & there is a regular (half hourly) bus service from these towns running right past my premises & a bus stop no more than 100 yards away. Many of my employees cycle to work from these towns. There really is no excuse for being late for an interview. What does it say about someone's reliability & punctuality if they can't get to an interview on time?  Incidentally, I'm also finding that interviewees are arriving inappropriately dressed (I don't expect a business suit but neither do I expect ripped/dirty jeans & rock band t-shirts), having no idea what my business does even though a quick Google search would tell them, & no grasp of what the role involves despite me providing a detailed job spec. Again I've told JobCentre what I expect but nothing changes!

Men (and women) with considerable knowledge about the infrastructure were suddenly vulnerable to redundancy, and many were, in the face of improved efficiency, contractors were brought in to do jobs which they had little experience of - damp brick work of various different grades layered on top of each other, the aerodynamic forces involved as trains pass through tunnels, national British Standards for construction and components being replaced with a variety of often less stringent European standards as contractors were sought from overseas.

99	37860579		wombatman	12	07 July 2014 10:42am	Surely the fine should go on benefitting all those who sere affeccted by lack of punctuality. Perhaps they might note that the majority of people on commuter routes are not using Wi-Fi. many cannot even get a seat, and numerous read the free newspapers. Spend the money as the union states on safety measures, or more carriages, or anything that all passengers that will benefit from.
