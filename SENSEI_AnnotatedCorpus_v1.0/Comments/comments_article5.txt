1	38240015		Boston2014	91	16 July 2014 5:24pm	Scott Brown has no shame. He moves from state to state in the hopes of being elected again to further his career as a politician. He doesn't care who or what he represents, the only thing that matters to him is having a big cushy job on the tax payers dime.
2	38241563	38240015	aleatico	19	16 July 2014 6:19pm	Sounds like Hillary.
3	38241591	38240015	Cooper2345	10	16 July 2014 6:20pm	Wait, are you describing Hillary Clinton?
4	38241760	38240015	beathoven	37	16 July 2014 6:27pm	And claims to be a "fiscal conservative" but actually wants to give lots of money to the welfare kings in Big Oil, Big Ag and weaponry, like his GOP pals.
5	38242426	38241591	Longhaultrucker	56	16 July 2014 6:48pm	Here's a list of states where Hillary Clinton has run for elected office:New York State.erThat's it. Her husband was governor of Arkansas, sure, and she's been Secretary of State and ran for president. But I don't think she's held state-level office anywhere else. I accept, however, that you just wanted to have a pop at Hillary Clinton regardless of accuracy.

Replace the first words of your rant with "Politicians have", and your comment will begin to carry some weight.
7	38243510	38242426	aleatico	3	16 July 2014 7:34pm	Hillary moved once to run for public office, to New York. Scott grew up in Massachusetts, went to Tufts (in Massachusetts) for undergraduate, and got a JD from Boston College (in Massachusetts), before holding public office in (you guessed it) Massachusetts. In other words, Brown has moved just once (to New Hampshire) to run for public office. Which puts him in the same class as Hillary (though a good proportion of New Hampshire actually works in Massachusetts). I think the real inaccuracy lies with Boston2014 when he said Scott moved from state to state to pursue office.
8	38243972	38243510	aleatico	0	16 July 2014 7:50pm	Actually, I should have said that Boston2014 said that Scott "moves from state to state" -- which is a use of the habitual present, describing a repeated action over time. There was no repeated moving to another state in pursuit of public office.
9	38244717	38241563	Zepp	17	16 July 2014 8:15pm	Wave your arms! Shout "Whatabout!"  If criticism of your opportunistic carpetbagger makes you uncomfortable, maybe you need a new hobby lobby...
10	38245306	38243510	Longhaultrucker	5	16 July 2014 8:35pm	I wasn't worked up about the Brown point. I was just pointing out that Hillary Clinton, while she held a cabinet office in Arkansas, has sought elected office in only one state.
11	38245849	38241563	proton58	4	16 July 2014 8:53pm	No, just describing another right wing asshole.
12	38246359	38244717	aleatico	1	16 July 2014 9:10pm	I'm a member of the New Whig Party, which hasn't endorsed either the carpetbagger Hillary or the carpetbagger Brown. Don't imagine they, or I, ever will.
13	38246391	38245306	aleatico	1	16 July 2014 9:11pm	You've roused my curiosity. What cabinet level position did she hold in Arkansas?
14	38249799	38243510	bushwhacked	3	16 July 2014 11:24pm	<blockquote>  Scott grew up in Massachusetts, went to Tufts (in Massachusetts) for undergraduate, and got a JD from Boston College (in Massachusetts), before holding public office in (you guessed it) Massachusetts.

15	38250214	38249799	aleatico	0	16 July 2014 11:42pm	I omitted that, despite the fact that it undermines the claim that he's just a carpetbagger (somewhat) for the simple fact that it isn't true. He was born in Kittery, Maine, across the Piscataqua River from Portsmouth, New Hampshire. The source of confusion is the fact that he was born at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, which is in Kittery, Maine, rather than Portsmouth, New Hampshire. His parents divorced when he was less than a year old, and he and his single mom moved in with relatives in Wakefield, Massachusetts, where he eventually graduated from high school.
16	38250346	38241760	Anthony Irwin	6	16 July 2014 11:47pm	Most of them aren't fiscally conservative. They just route money toward their campaign funders. Since single mom's, elderly, unemployed, poor, suffering from illness and so on, don't fund their campaigns, they first shame them for political brownie points, and then they want to divert any help going to them toward their military/police/prison/oil/toxic waste/banking campaign funders. Democrats do this too, but to a lesser degree. They at least don't pretend to be fiscally conservative.

19	38251720	38240015	Bob Chuey	4	17 July 2014 12:58am	Republicans desperate efforts to take over leadership of the US are becoming more and more underhanded. The referendum on splitting the state of California into six states is just another effort to garner control of the congress. Shame on the all the gerrymandering they have done throughout the country to undermine the electoral process. Always with the underhanded, disingenuous tactics because their agenda has become so radicalized.
20	38252321	38251720	aleatico	0	17 July 2014 1:35am	The Six Californias Proposal, which will never be brought into being, is the brainchild of a venture capitalist who has donated to both parties and candidates in both parties. I'm not aware that the Republican Party has a position on the matter. I do find it humorous that Dems, who loved gerrymandering when they did it, suddenly find that it undermines electoral politics when the Republicans do it.
21	38273956	38241591	peakchoicedotorg	0	17 July 2014 1:20pm	Maybe they could run together.

If you would have persisted, and with a bit of luck provoked this clod into some kind of physical assault which would have undoubtedly ended up as a viral YouTube sensation, you could have ended this asshole's run for Senate in a single afternoon.  I mean, come on. You're being fairly well paid by the Guardian. I'm sure they provide decent healthcare insurance and would have rallied around you without reserve. I think a black eye and a split lip would be a small price to pay for a public service of such magnitude. Would have looked pretty good on your resume, too.
25	38241207	38240669	paullewisreporter	98	16 July 2014 6:06pm	Yes, I folded. I like how you presume that I was the one who would have ended up in hospital, with a black eye and split lip, but considering the size of my adversary, his back-up, and the fact I'm instinctively more of a 'flight' than a 'fight' kind of guy, you're probably right. Alas, I am no <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFL_rOcmYFo" rel="nofollow">Hunter S Thompson</a>.
26	38241885	38241207	kenalexruss	4	16 July 2014 6:31pm	It's courage (and a bit of stupidity?), not strength that gets you the black eye and fat lip! It also gets you lots of sympathy from readers and loved ones alike! Now you know, so next jump right in and know that all will be well! Not to mention the financial benefits will help with medical expenses, suffering, etc. This is a war of ideologies and if you're on the front lines you might consider taking a hit for the team. The opposition's tactics are very dirty and cross all sectors of good behavior. Fight fire with water, it always works best!
27	38242364	38241207	Longhaultrucker	18	16 July 2014 6:46pm	As a newspaper reporter who's occasionally been in some tricky situations, I have to say that flight is precisely the right way out of these kinds of situations. People get angry enough. There's no need to invite assault. I like to think that I have moral courage, while lacking physical courage...
28	38243228	38241207	gunnison	6	16 July 2014 7:22pm	<blockquote>  I like how you presume that I was the one who would have ended up in hospital, with a black eye and split lip </blockquote> Oh hello Paul. I was not suggesting you lack the ability to lay waste to Brown's entire entourage should the need arise (you look young enough, and skinny as a snake in your photo, so I assumed you'd do just fine), I was suggesting you fall on your sword for the greater good.  A magnificent opportunity squandered; a mortal wound to the Brown campaign, inestimably more clicks for the Gardenia on the ensuing story and video (a pay raise in the offing, without a doubt), your stock as a heroic journalist totally through the roof, and the undying gratitude of a grateful nation. It's also possible I wasn't entirely in earnest, though I'll be unlikely ever to admit it. Good piece, btw.:)
29	38245082	38241207	Corrections	5	16 July 2014 8:26pm	John Oliver, moral compass of British-American journalists everywhere, would have done. He might have even cringed first, and then taken a Premier League dive, screaming bloody murder, if the guy had actually done anything.  If you get another opportunity, remember to have your phone camera running. Better yet, the phone cameras of some "innocent bystanders" aka accomplices.
30	38245602	38240669	Philip W	17	16 July 2014 8:45pm	It is an excellent article and I think the Author behaved professionally. Brown does have a bad temper and would have lost it; however, some people do not like to provoke this way. So, I commend the writer for taking the time to pursue what he did. New Hampshire will see the real Brown as the campaign goes on.

Like "The Gambler" he "knew when to hold". It was Brown who folded -- hiding in the men's room, calling the cops. What a wimp. No wonder the cop was amused.
33	38251910	38241207	Bob Chuey	11	17 July 2014 1:10am	Lowering yourself to the level of these scum bags would have been spun to somehow make Brown the victim. Thanks for the report on this mercenary for the ever more desperate GOP. Their major candidates for US congressional and higher offices for some time now have used evasion and strong-arm tactics in dealing with the media reps that are not already in their pocket. RNC is organized crime.Thank you Paul, keep reporting from the front lines of America's dirty campaign front.
34	38252829	38241207	Carol Spade	11	17 July 2014 2:07am	Who folded? It was Brown who hid in the bathroom.
35	38253084	38241207	tigi	4	17 July 2014 2:26am	You were wise to fold. American political campaigns are far too close to what Russian politics are like. Had you persisted in your attempt to interview Brown you probably would have been "roughed up" and never had proper redress. Funny thing that image of America as an open and free country.........it is, as long as you don't cross the line.

40	38292027	38240669	Daver Dave	3	17 July 2014 9:21pm	I'm not sure what more you would have him do. As far as I'm concerned Brown's reaction to the question (hiding in the bathroom, running away, threatening violence if Mr. Lewis didn't leave and then calling the cops) is answer enough for me.
41	38302289	38240669	ID7742865	1	18 July 2014 4:26am	I think calling the cops to oust a reporter should be enough to show people the kind of guy Scott Brown is. In fact, the kind of party the Republican Party is in many parts of the country. Decrying government interference all the time and then calling on the government to harass someone exercising First Amendment rights (much as they did at their convention)? What else does a voter need to know?

44	38241167		nk1402	57	16 July 2014 6:05pm	This would be hilarious if it wasn't so representative of the state of US politics, particularly (but not only) on the Republican side. Those people just want to get into office, mingle with their (male, white, Christian) friends, play big-shot politics (hey mum, I'm a senator!), cash in, but not be held accountable for anything. I genuinely don't think public service ever comes into it. What a joke.
45	38244991	38241167	Zepp	33	16 July 2014 8:24pm	There actually was a case a few months ago where a Republican Congressman, Michael Grimm, physically threatened a reporter for asking a question about campaign finance irregularities. Grimm has since resigned over those irregularities.  This isn't to say Brown would do the same, but when you look at how a lot of Republican elected officials behave in public, a certain caution is called for when dealing with them. A whip and a chair might be handy.
46	38246771	38241167	Northeaster	5	16 July 2014 9:23pm	<blockquote>  mingle with their (male, white, Christian) friends </blockquote>  Easily interchanged with: male, white, Jewish - See Sen. Chuck Schumer, never met a Wall Street Banker he didn't like to take money from.
47	38249187	38246771	knuckles66	3	16 July 2014 10:58pm	Chuck Schumer, who represents my state, NY, is a nauseating example of the breed. By the way, old Chuck was the author of the law that made the Hobby Lobby decision possible. And in true Schumer fashion, he and his staff have been hiding from questions ever since.
48	38250212	38246771	hrafnkat	5	16 July 2014 11:42pm	<blockquote>   mingle with their (male, white, Christian) friends    Easily interchanged with: male, white, Jewish - See Sen. Chuck Schumer, never met a Wall Street Banker he didn't like to take money from.  </blockquote>  Not so easily interchanged for Republicans, it would seem.  The last Jewish Republican member of Congress, Eric Cantor, lost his re-election last month. There will be no Jewish Republicans in either the House or the Senate after his term is up. All of the Republicans are now Christian (or at least they profess to be, I'm sure there must be some who are agnostic/atheist, but can't admit to that in public). Republicans have no African-American members of Congress. There are 7 Latinos, one of whom is a woman. The numbers for the last (113th) Congress were 233 Republicans in the House of Representatives, and 45 in the Senate. Out of the 278 Republican members of Congress, 252 were men, 26 were women. 271 were white, 7 were Latino. 277 were Christian, 1 was Jewish. That looks pretty heavily weighted in favour of "male, white, Christian" from where I'm standing.

US could have modeled healthcare reform from any number of countries successful systems, instead they (Congress) invented a convoluted, incomprehensible (to the average citizen), that keeps insurers as the beneficiaries and overseers of the highest priced least satisfactory outcome system in the developed world.
54	38283142	38241637	waltzaway	1	17 July 2014 4:44pm	Healthcare would be much better off with HSA. Costs are kept lower when you don' t have to process claims and people seek out the best bang for their buck. Paying more for xrays doesn' t mean better xrays.When shopping I paid about 25% of the cost of the services my doctor recommended. Prices can be posted on the web, just like food menus for some enlightened chains.Wait until all Americans have VA care standards.
55	38241846		MartiniShaken1	72	16 July 2014 6:30pm	This makes me want to quit my job and become a journalist. When your profession reduces (sleazy) public figures to hiding in bathrooms to avoid you... you've done a good day's work.  I do work with journalists and know full well there is a fine line between having a relationship that grants you access to a public figure and having "too friendly" relationship with them that begins to effect the objectivity and aggressiveness of reporting. Far too many Washington journalists have fallen into the dangerous place of trading their sharp pencil for easy access. Good to see a reporter making a politician sweat with a legitimate line of inquiry. Gunnison may have had tongue in cheek, but there wasn't much Mr. Lewis could have done in a situation where staff/bouncer of the bar asked him to leave. It was a private business place and they can ask you to leave for pretty much whatever reason they come up with.  Panicking and calling in the local police (was it Andy Griffith? It sounded like him) is priceless. If this is Brown's staff in action, he hasn't a prayer. This is rank amateurism.

62	38241989		aleatico	2	16 July 2014 6:34pm	<blockquote>   "It is routine for journalists to ask you questions and usually the candidates answer." </blockquote>  In what parallel universe? I'd say the standard practice is the opposite. In fact, outside of press conferences or arranged interviews, the rest is becoming known as "ambush journalism" -- which, given the connotation of 'ambush', I take to be pejorative.
63	38243779	38241989	hoyoku	35	16 July 2014 7:43pm	Ah, but this is a British journalist following a long standing tradition of not allowing public figures to dictate the terms of a conversation - unlike the generally more wimpy, conciliatory American versions.
64	38244186	38241989	Corrections	38	16 July 2014 7:58pm	No. "Ambush journalism" is problematical when applied to celebrities going about their ordinary daily business, but not to politicians who are running to represent their future constituents - especially not at a campaign event. The job of the free press is to interrogate them on behalf of these people. Hence, "fourth estate". The politician doesn't have to answer, but calling the police to have journalists removed is a bit rich. You're clearly confusing the role of journalist with that of press agent.
65	38250761	38244186	aleatico	1	17 July 2014 12:07am	I'm just going by wikipedia and my own casual empiricism (flawed as it may be). From wikipedia:  <blockquote>  Ambush journalism Ambush journalism refers to aggressive tactics practiced by journalists to suddenly confront and question people who otherwise do not wish to speak to a journalist. The practice has particularly been applied by television journalists, on news shows like The O'Reilly Factor [1] and 60 Minutes[citation needed] and by Geraldo Rivera and other local television reporters conducting investigations.    The practice has been sharply criticized by journalists and others as being highly unethical and sensational, while others defend it as the only way to attempt to provide those subject to it an opportunity to comment for a report. This can usually be discerned by the level of physical aggression the journalist displays and in the time allowed for an uninterrupted answer.  </blockquote>  Since a press agent doesn't usually ask probing questions of his client, on the record, at even press conferences or interviews, I'll have to depart from your view that I've confused the roles of press agents and journalists, though I will concede there may be divergent majority attitudes towards ambush journalism on different sides of the pond (just as there are differences in libel laws, which might make the British counterparts something less than the searching advocates of truth some might imagine them to be). That said, having the police called is something else altogether, especially when conducted on someone else's property that offers public access.  It probably isn't much appreciated on the other side of the pond that some "campaign events" are treated as private endeavors, even when conducted in public. For instance, the record is full of instances where, having received a permit, Obama campaigners banned unsympathetic public from "campaign events" on public property that were little more than dog and pony shows for the cameras, designed to show Obama surrounded by nothing but supporters. And this is not an Obama phenomenon exclusively. Far from it.

67	38287695	38255553	aleatico	0	17 July 2014 6:59pm	Granted, but in printing only the truth, it foregoes some truth beyond the evidentiary burden on the respondent. Being more careful doesn't necessarily make one more searching.

Brown's refusal to talk to a potentially unfriendly journalist brings to mind Bush/Cheney who would not admit anybody to their campaign rallies who was not a true believer. Does not seem like a good way to create a dialog.

74	38242813		deddzone	17	16 July 2014 7:03pm	From the article: "Scott Brown supports women's healthcare and access to contraception, but by injecting government into every aspect of our lives, Obamacare threatens all our freedoms," Guyton said. "The best solution is to repeal it." And replace it with..? Does Mr. Brown know how many Republicans like the ACA and signed up for it?

I am sure Mr. Brown is a reasonably nice man, the kind of fellow you'd be happy to have as a next door neighbor, letting you borrow his lawn mower, taking in the mail while you were on vacation, helping you clean your rain gutters in the Fall. But a United States Senator? Umm . . . no thanks. He literally has nothing to say, other than that he's "bi-partisan", whatever that is supposed to mean. (Actually, it means that he's not completely batshit crazy, like most of the rest of the Republican Party these days, which is probably fair enough.) If you sat down with Scott Brown and wanted to have a detailed, nuts-and-bolts discussion of any issue of current importance - tax policy, financial regulation, the Middle East, energy policy - you would get about a minute's worth (if that) of pre-canned, pre-digested, substance-free "talking points", at which point he would literally have nothing left to say. Not the sharpest knife in the drawer. He was my U.S. Senator for 2+ years, and left no hint of accomplishment after he was rather easily defeated for re-election by Elizabeth Warren in 2012. This is his swan song; Jeanne Shaheen, who has been elected to state-wide office in New Hampshire three times now, is going to feed him his lunch. Bye-bye, Scott.

79	38243162		ArkEton	4	16 July 2014 7:19pm	The claim "he's anti-women" should be toxic - to the dolt who says it.
80	38243165		ByrdSong	9	16 July 2014 7:20pm	Don't ask him about the Hobby Lobby ruling, but do ask him about all the innocents being killed in Gaza by NitWhityahoo and his citizen assassins with their rocket batteries. Boom. It could have been you for all he cares. Me
81	38243172		nauseausa	15	16 July 2014 7:20pm	Team him up with Paul Ryan and we only have 10 months open to fill out the Republican wet T-shirt pin up calendar for 2014.
82	38243526		ByrdSong	2	16 July 2014 7:34pm	Fighting a computer operating system is harder than you think, until it finally realizes that's all I'm fighting. Think I'll go do something else. Without a computer.
83	38243884		Adoniran	22	16 July 2014 7:47pm	Paul has Brown dodging him like he owes him money, and I love it. It doesn't take much pressure for this weasel to show his true colors, does it? It's a bad situation when you're afraid to even acknowledge the positions you've already publicly chosen.
84	38243964		Jazzy J Man	5	16 July 2014 7:50pm	Don't be surprised if you find yourself on the US no-fly list and/or your laptop is confiscated. Remember you're dealing with the people that run a brutal, repressive, police state.

86	38284037	38243964	herebutforfortune	2	17 July 2014 5:12pm	Scott Brown isn't even a nominee yet for government office, just an unemployed private-citizen candidate for the GOP primary, having lost his seat in the Senate, and you think he's got what kind of power?!
87	38244015		Alwick	22	16 July 2014 7:52pm	While Brown was running for re-election in Massachusetts he was scheduled to do his annual two weeks National Guard duty. He wrangled to get himself posted to an office in Afghanistan, thus becoming an "Afghanistan Veteran". In truth it was nothing more than a publicity stunt. When he returned from his dangerous vacation, he was promoted to full Colonel, with his wings being awarded by John McCain.
88	38244125	38244015	Justlyjohn	9	16 July 2014 7:56pm	Yeah those coward colonels are the same.
89	38298253	38244015	marshwren	2	18 July 2014 12:16am	Didn't Sen. Graham (aka Miss Lindsey of the Vapors) do the same thing recently--spending a week or two in Iraq as a JAG advocate? Like Brown, i'm sure hanging out on-base the whole time, putting in a few hours a day shuffling papers, and hob nobbing with the brass in the officer's club made them even more expert on WoT foreign policy than either of already considered themselves to be.
90	38244057		FelixOliver	12	16 July 2014 7:53pm	Scott Brown hates health care for women and children. He will lose in NH just as he did in Massachusetts.
91	38244701		babymamaboy	26	16 July 2014 8:15pm	It is very unfair for a politician to take a public stance on issues. They are supposed to vote based on which lobby group offers them more money. As a journalist you should be writing articles on how great his hair looks. And as a citizen you should be more concerned about making your corporate masters happy. It's called freedom.
92	38244756		Corrections	26	16 July 2014 8:17pm	What I remember about Scott Brown's earlier pandering to the Roman Catholic voters was his "stand" on allowing Catholic hospitals to send a rape victim elsewhere for the "morning after pill". That pill prevents implantation (which to Hobby Lobby makes it an "abortifacient' for some unknown, unscientific reason) which means the sooner it's taken, the better. So here we have a rape victim, taken to the nearest hospital. Which might be Roman Catholic. They treat her, but refuse to give her the pill. She has to wait until they're through, and then they call a taxi to take her somewhere else to get the pill. Being "good Catholics", they're in no rush to speed this up: the longer they delay, the more likely the woman is to become pregnant. The woman becomes increasingly agitated as time passes. The rape was traumatic enough, and now she's surrounded by people telling her not to worry and to trust in "God's will." As if. Scott Brown is a hypocrite, imo. He's figuring there are more "conservative" voters than rape victims.

94	38245953	38244756	SanJoseGrunge	16	16 July 2014 8:56pm	Actually, the grand comedy behind the morning-after pill and the Hobby Lobby decision is that the morning-after pill doesn't prevent implantation according to lots and lots and lots of recent research. It prevents ovulation, meaning that even by the dumbass standards of the bible-slingers, it's not an abortifacient. The "prevents implantation" bit was included in labeling for it back when research on the subject was flimsy, and still has yet to be taken out, despite people in the FDA asking that it be. Pregnancy rates among women who'd taken it after ovulation were no different from control groups. There's a brief in the Hobby Lobby case, filed by shitloads of ob/gyns, to that effect, as well studies on pubmed and a study finished in Europe last year.
95	38249574	38245953	OXMS38655	10	16 July 2014 11:14pm	The fact is of course the facts don't really matter, expert scientific opinion can't be allowed to cloud the issue. Its what the employer 'sincerely "believes" to be true' becomes the justification for their preventing the access to these contraceptives. Ridiculous.
96	38289026	38249574	SanJoseGrunge	2	17 July 2014 7:46pm	Ugh. That only compounds things. In the Hobby Lobby case, the employer is a corporation, a person legally distinct from it's owners. The idea that this "person," conjured from paper and legalisms, has "sincere religious beliefs" about anything is incredibly laughable.
97	38298594	38289026	marshwren	0	18 July 2014 12:29am	<blockquote>  The idea that this "person," conjured from paper and legalisms, has "sincere religious beliefs" about anything is incredibly laughable. </blockquote>  Yes, indeed--recognizing the "religious rights" of corporations is as funny now as when the same Court recognized their "free speech" rights (Citizen's United). But a case can (and probably soon will) be made that the last laugh belongs to us, as per the law of unintended consequences: <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/03/28/1287909/-Papantonio-Hobby-Lobby-Is-DOA?detail=facebook" rel="nofollow">http://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/03/28/1287909/-Papantonio-Hobby-Lobby-Is-DOA?detail=facebook</a>
98	38245038		donkeybreadth	1	16 July 2014 8:25pm	It is very clear that the Guardian lot are still seething with all this Hobby Lobby stuff. Lefties do get, and stay, hot and bothered at any ruling against them
99	38245367	38245038	Corrections	38	16 July 2014 8:37pm	Damn straight.  Five old Roman Catholic men, deathly afraid of being excommunicated, are therefore deciding personal matters for the entire country based on their personal religious views. And you don't see a problem? Wow.
100	38246041	38245038	SanJoseGrunge	24	16 July 2014 8:59pm	I'm not a lefty, and the ruling pisses me right the fuck off.
