1	31559606		FundamentalistGoblin	38	04 February 2014 3:56pm	Saying that the floods were hailed as a "once-in-100-years" event, is misleading. 1:100 year flood is a technical way of describing the scale of the flood, and doesn't mean that a similar size event could not occur 2 years later.
2	31561359	31559606	jayant	13	04 February 2014 4:41pm	It means that there is 1% probability of a flood of this magnitude IF similar conditions prevail. It may happen next year or may not happen in 20 next years.
3	31564185	31561359	FundamentalistGoblin	3	04 February 2014 6:05pm	Precisely.
4	31565437	31559606	hertsred	5	04 February 2014 6:39pm	And basing claims of likelihood on past data ignores the fact that the atmosphere is warming, that a warmer atmosphere and sea means that more moisture is picked up from the Atlantic and then dumps on the UK. So rain like this is going to become ever more frequent. Add rising sea levels to that and within a short time it is likely that the Somerset levels will once again become large marshy and tidal waterways. One of the options for the name Somerset is from the Saxon phrase that means something like 'dwellers by marshy lakes'. Heading that way again.
5	31565581	31559606	scrotgrot	2	04 February 2014 6:42pm	In any case, 100 years is the perfect timescale for justifying large infrastructure works.
6	31572983	31565437	FundamentalistGoblin	3	04 February 2014 9:45pm	Oh, not disputing the fact that its changing, just pointing out its a statistical means of describing flood size, not a statement on when it will "do it again".
7	31576272	31559606	bpowell555	0	04 February 2014 11:10pm	The input timescale is almost certainly not 100 years of data, so that the probability is a pure guess; more likely its an extrapolation based on the typical variation in rainfall observed over say 50 years. Given the Earth is 2 billion years old the nature of these assumptions is easy to black-swan-the-fuck-outta-here. Still, its the most useful and workable measure we have.
8	31598932	31559606	SinkingSlowly	0	05 February 2014 1:41pm	We have a full record for Yeovilton going back to 1910. The first complete year is 1911. It is very informative! The simple message from the historical record is this: these are not epoch changing levels of rainfall by any means. The fact that historic floods are being registered cannot be blamed on the levels of precipitation. If the houses on the Levels did not flood in 1990 or 1915, it is a great surprise that they are flooding now. The floods started on 24 Dec 2013. In the two months prior to that, Yeovilton recorded 428 mm of rain. That is the 92nd wettest November/December since 1911. That's not really even a 1 in 2 year event. Furthermore, Summer was almost the definition of "average" (61st wettest), so the Agency had reasonable conditions to undertake the maintenance of the flood defences. As for 2012-13, it was the 22nd wettest winter since 1911. So that's about a 1 in 5 year event. If the Levels endure the wettest January and February on record, the Winter rainfall will just exceed that of 1990. So the measure is more workable than perhaps you thought, precisely because it's telling us that the Agency is selling the public a rather mangy pup!
9	31599167	31565437	SinkingSlowly	0	05 February 2014 1:45pm	Except the data doesn't show anything of the sort!
10	31603601	31599167	hertsred	0	05 February 2014 3:25pm	Can't work out which bit you are referring to, but the data does show atmospheric and sea temperatures rising, and hat inevitably puts more moisture into the Atlantic winds. Which means more rain in the UK. The important point about the amount of rain is how much arrives how quickly, not how much over an entire winter. It is also not about how quickly he levels of rain rise, but that over many years there is a steady increase of moisture in the atmosphere, that is beginning to happen and will get worse as the years go by. The averages are rising and as the do the Levels will sink and we will not be able to defend them without spending vast amounts of money. however, a fantastic and beautiful ecosystem will be reborn and we will learn to live with that.
11	31559783		spinnyspace	226	04 February 2014 4:00pm	And no doubt it will not take the loonies to start posting their disgust that HRH Charles has got in there and poked his nose in where it doesn't belong. For me, well done for caring and an extra well done for Not putting off a trip that had been prearranged because of difficulties. Biggest problem Charles faces now a days is the critics who simply cannot match his compassion and knowledge of the people of this country. So instead they use the media and stupid people to attack his efforts. That he is unable to respond makes him the perfect target. And I'm incline to believe that it is not simply the republicans among us who are guilty, I see connections with many Tory MPs who criticise him for treading on their toes. Glad someone is.
12	31561211	31559783	Agir	76	04 February 2014 4:37pm	How about he hand over all 'his' land to the hard working tenant farmers?
13	31561400	31559783	VSLVSL	79	04 February 2014 4:42pm	I think you'll find that most republicans have no interest either way in the Prince of Wales or his coterie - save in so far as their conduct damages the rest of Britain. As to his visit to Somerset:- if someone with power listens I'm sure that's to the good. The notion that Charles is unable to respond or is without influence is plainly self-delusion on your part - The Guardian's ongoing campaign to understand the private (subterranean) and extensive influence this man has on government is commendable but I fear only winkles-out the least of his powers.

'His' lands, inluding the Duchy of Coornwall, support thousands of livelihoods, and I couldn't imagine him setting his seal of approval to fracking.

These people are a joke, one that we have to pay to support.

23	31663747	31562522	Ossie Bullock	0	07 February 2014 3:50am	"A large proportion of the population..." Um, what proportion would that be, exactly? Or even approximately, for that matter? I'd guess a "large proportion" would normally be taken to mean 50%+...or perhaps 25% by other definitions...or 10% at least, surely, and even that seems an odd use of the phrase? I mean, if only 10% of the population voted Conservative, would you agree with someone who claimed that "a large proportion of the population supports the Tories"? But let's be generous, and call 10% a large proportion. That would mean that about 6.4 million people in the UK only scrape by with help from food banks, yes? That's odd: I don't think food banks currently claim to provide food for more than at most 200,000 people in the UK. Let's increase that (in your favour) by a half to 300K . That's, um, less than 1/20 of 6 million. So in fact in a generous approx guesstimate sort of way you might be justified in saying that 0.5% of the population can only scrape by with the help of food banks. This would seem to imply that you think one-half of one per cent is "a large proportion". How would you describe the other 99.5%, I wonder? I've seen some ridiculous posts on CiF but this one takes the biscuit...oh sorry, perhaps you've got copyright on that phrase.

No. So who is the prat? Money that is ours really - unless Charlie boy has been putting in some shifts at McDonald's or something and he's putting up the money out of own pocket.  He inherited the land he "owns" and pretty much everything that comes with it, still nice that he can throw a few pennies back.

43	31561431	31560809	excathedra	28	04 February 2014 4:42pm	Charles hasn't done anything himself - he's had them started on his behalf done with money he hasn't earned and run by others. He just pops along. The money " donated " isn't even from his own pocket ( our money really ) but from one of the numerous charities funded by others. Same as his dad and the Duke of Edinburgh Award which he never even bothered to do.  Fine, if you're impressed with this kind of vacuous " celebrity " culture but many of us are not in thrall to this family of benefit recipients.

And &#163;50.000 from a multi millionaire???Is that not the same as a morbidly obese person throwing away the last crisp after eating the whole packet, just to placate his conscience?

I want our public services back. I want leaders taking responsibility for what they're responsible for.  The royal likes his environmental issues but he's not in charge. It's not his remit.  It's Cameron's job & at the moment & all he can say through a nameless spokesperson is, "it's unacceptable!" right, thanks Dave, that doesn't cut it.

49	31560265		BobJanova	172	04 February 2014 4:13pm	Charles is one of the best royals, particularly for rural affairs. He's dealt with his endless next-guy-in-waiting status by removing himself from London, taking him under the media radar most of the time, and devoting himself to preservation of 'olde England' and valuable aspects of rural life. Not only has he shown up in this part of the world which is not-London (and not-next-to-London; apparently Cam can make it to Kent), unlike all the main government figures, but he's giving material aid to get something done immediately. Good on him.

No, this is the reporting that has been done by the Graun and the Indy over the past year. Ministers show draft legislation that may affect the Queen or Charles to their staff. If they object to any clauses they are removed even before the draft bill gets to Parliament. Charles in particular has been aggressive in using this power to protect the commercial interests of the Duchy of Cornwall. All very dodgy stuff indeed. They also get a review of draft bills before they pass the final stages in Parliament.

72	31560284		appalledandawstruck	31	04 February 2014 4:13pm	Prince Charles can't lose by going down there, although he didn't expect the dire situation. That's the beauty of having the status and none of the responsibilities.  For Cameron it's a whole different story.
73	31563195	31560284	MikeRichards	19	04 February 2014 5:34pm	You'd have thought Cameron would have got his priorities right and paid them a visit, after all some Conservative seats are under water.
74	31573841	31563195	smeg40	4	04 February 2014 10:06pm	They should've taken them upstairs.
75	31584034	31560284	schwitters	1	05 February 2014 7:39am	It is part of the Tory narrative and ideology and what may appear a lack of urgency is actually a considered response for them not to get involved. They they want to scale back what they see as state interference in as many projects as possible. The fact that HRH and others are now giving charity justifies their response, in their mindset. For those of us who do see a role for government in these kinds of emergencies simply because the state has the structural resources, is equipped to react (when funded) and is able to provide a coordinated response (let us leave democracy out of this for the moment) it is a reaction to a tragedy that only makes sense in the present Tory way of thinking, and acting.  They will hold back as they are "educating' the population to think for themselves, stand on their own feet, roll up their sleeve etc. It is a high risk strategy only in the sense that they need to manage the piece in a PR way that keeps their ideological impulse hidden from view, for now. There will be those Tories who believe that communities like this ought to sink or swim (literally) and whatever emerges all be a better honed society.It is what they believe and has a certain logic. for them. Organised, charitable chaos is piecemeal in these kinds of happenings. But these kinds of reactions from government will increase just so long as the the media pressure is kept in check. Meanwhile their are some really miserable folks having a really bad time of it. I've been there, flooded out, and it is truly depressing and traumatic, believe me. But their government does not want to get involved if it can help it.
76	31560329		buckler	6	04 February 2014 4:14pm	Does he reckon that the Levels will be shoe-in country for the Tory people?
77	31560351		MELSM	15	04 February 2014 4:15pm	Cameron hasn't visited? But he's on TV and radio several times each day.  The position of PM isn't what it was, obviously. All mystique has gone.
78	31576574	31560351	citizenJA	1	04 February 2014 11:20pm	Correct.
79	31560354		Willemm	19	04 February 2014 4:15pm	Presumably Somerset is not a potential fracking site. Unlucky chaps.
80	31563241	31560354	MikeRichards	5	04 February 2014 5:36pm	Licences have been granted to explore for coal bed methane around Keynsham, Midsomer Norton, Peasedown and Chew Magna. They're in the bumpy bit of Somerset though.

82	31573424	31564920	junks	2	04 February 2014 9:54pm	When I was at school in Somerset, The Mendips did not have a rogue apostrophe in them.
83	31574246	31563241	Johnnyboyant	4	04 February 2014 10:16pm	Oh no, the darned frackers are also after our dear Somerset!! Frack off, the lot of you.
84	31580276	31564920	Shaukit Sadiq	0	05 February 2014 2:12am	Sounds nasty, I wouldn't want to sniff round there, not before they've had a wash anyway.
85	31560355		00jebus	64	04 February 2014 4:15pm	Actually a useful role for royalty, but the fact that nobody accountable for flood defences, or responsible for their funding in the future, is there, speaks volumes.(Isn't the enviroment agency being made to find cuts too?)I supose he could lobby goverment, but that isn't an ideal solution is it? Still, well done to Charles, poor show goverment, if you are going to cut then you should at least have the backbane to find out what those cuts will actually mean and take responsibility for it. 2 things which are lacking from most of our current MPs.
86	31560903	31560355	FundamentalistGoblin	18	04 February 2014 4:29pm	There are lots of EA guys on the ground from what i've seen, that's who is operating the pumping stations/defences. Just not their senior management. Having said that, if i lived there, i think i'd prefer the guys who know what they are doing
87	31573534	31560355	VSLVSL	13	04 February 2014 9:57pm	You'd think that Owen Paterson would want to explain to the people of Somerset why he's cut their funding!
88	31560390		Waterkanter	60	04 February 2014 4:16pm	Cameron wouldn't get his feet wet unless his boots were laden with party contributions. Prince Charles even made a donation. Where are all those Tory donors who are not short of a bob or two?
89	31562781	31560390	friarjohn	10	04 February 2014 5:22pm	Hopefully if his boot where full of party contributions that would hold him under the water!
90	31573928	31560390	Streatham	7	04 February 2014 10:08pm	<blockquote>  Prince Charles even made a donation. </blockquote>  A bit like saying the Kray Brothers 'made a donation'. Every penny he has was stolen from our ancestors or comes from our taxes.
91	31560391		uncollective	13	04 February 2014 4:16pm	Exactly what would Cameron or Lord Smith add at this stage? Apart from diverting even more staff from clearing things up to dragging their boats around?
92	31560712	31560391	00jebus	93	04 February 2014 4:24pm	It would send a message that they are willing to find out what cuts to the enviroment agency actually mean, and take responsibility for it. I wouldn't bet on them doing it though, no tory has yet showed up at a food bank to find out what welfare cuts result in, nor talked to actual doctors or nurses about what NHS cuts, chronnic underfunding, its target culture and partial privatisation mean for it. When you are just dealing with statistics, it is possible to become isolated from the situation, and thus lack empathy for what you do in goverment will actually result in.
93	31560916	31560712	MrBlueberry	19	04 February 2014 4:29pm	Good point, well said.
94	31561054	31560712	uncollective	2	04 February 2014 4:33pm	Every time I have seen a senior bod turn up a)it wrecks that day and probably a couple before it prepping for them b)its whitewashed anyway.
95	31562671	31561054	00jebus	4	04 February 2014 5:19pm	That says more about your work than anything tbh.
96	31576661	31560916	citizenJA	2	04 February 2014 11:22pm	<blockquote>  Good point, well said. </blockquote>  I agree with you, MrBlueberry & 00jebus.

The PM & his Cabinet of Ministers are in jobs requiring supervisory skills. This cannot be down exclusively through television, web feeds, text messages & Twitter.

I guess these decisions are so much easier to make when they're abstract, without any messy experience to get in the way. we're all in it together, now...
99	31560435		Grimley	22	04 February 2014 4:17pm	There is no market for weapons of war to exploit in Somerset. That's why no visit from Cameron.
100	31570123	31560435	worksforcommunityorg	1	04 February 2014 8:33pm	"There is no market for weapons of war to exploit in Somerset." Until not that long ago there was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROF_Bridgwater" rel="nofollow">a Royal Ordnance Factory near of Bridgwater</a>.
