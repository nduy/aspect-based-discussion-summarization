5	38332561		JeffersonAirplane	112	18 July 2014 7:52pm	I think we guarantee these places will be typical new builds which will mean no driveway, small, cramped roads and a postage stamp sized back garden.
6	38332843	38332561	TheRunawayFound	50	18 July 2014 8:02pm	And if they built them with spacious rooms, driveways, and large gardens you'd complain about the prices.
7	38332943	38332561	beadster	45	18 July 2014 8:05pm	Have you seen house prices lately? They need to be affordable apartments with shared gardens able to house much more than the typical English style home does.

11	38333418	38332943	kimdriver	23	18 July 2014 8:24pm	They'll need to be the sort of homes that people in the area want. Other than that, I agree totally. I live in London, no personal garden (just a patio which was a 42 centigrade death trap today) but with a public garden to which I have access (via an increased council tax). It wouldn't work well for a keen gardener, who would take pleasure from planning and growing things. But it works really well. Meet the neighbours. And we also have a few BBQs per year. Costs about me £80 per annum. And is managed by residents.
12	38333852	38332561	themuse	15	18 July 2014 8:41pm	Oh for goodness sake you sound like my father, expecting the worse even before they have put a spade to the ground works. At least they are taking a step in the right direction. You are damned if you do and damned if you don't in this country, to the point where I am sure there are a good many people who just ask themselves, why bother!
13	38333927	38332943	JeffersonAirplane	0	18 July 2014 8:44pm	If that is true, I weep for the potential new owners.
14	38334006	38332843	JeffersonAirplane	23	18 July 2014 8:47pm	Absolutely not, kind sir. I grew up in an ex council house so appreciate large rooms, having a drive way and a good garden. The house prices will be set by the market, my gripe is that housing in this country is getting smaller and smaller. If people want to live in hobbit homes, that's their business.
15	38334045	38333852	JeffersonAirplane	17	18 July 2014 8:49pm	Tesco aren't doing this for altruistic reasons, they're doing it because their business model is starting to wobble as people's spending habits and preference of supermarket are changing.  My complaint is general one: housing in this country is getting smaller, we should be like the Dutch!
16	38334107	38333418	JeffersonAirplane	9	18 July 2014 8:52pm	My last house had a 100 ft back garden and a 70 ft front one, years from now when I am sitting in my old rocking chair with my grandson Little Jeffy and I tell him that, he will have trouble believing it.
17	38335069	38334045	themuse	6	18 July 2014 9:30pm	<blockquote>  they're doing it because their business model is starting to wobble as people's spending habits and preference of supermarket are changing. </blockquote>  Be that as it may, it's probably a lot to do with boosting their bottom line as well, but at least they are going the right way about doing it, because it will help with the lack of housing in this country, so regardless of their reasons I for one will look at the positive side of it, until I hear they have altered their minds about it.  As for the size of houses, I agree with you completely, but even a small yard can become a beautiful outdoor space with a little imagination and research, after all most veggies can be grown in pots now and I think they look lovely as they are growing.  On the other hand having communal spaces may just help to get that feeling of community back as everyone within the area without their own outdoor spaces congregate on them.  As a country we need to learn to look at the good in something (where possible) instead of just focusing on the bad.
18	38335391	38332561	aliasatyl	8	18 July 2014 9:45pm	What's the bet that a Tescos 'local' will be the only shop allowed in the vicinity.
19	38336055	38334006	bromley	17	18 July 2014 10:14pm	Rooms getting smaller is a problem. It should be a legal requirement that housing particulars include the price per sq metre. A lack of gardens and parking spaces isn't a problem in urban areas. In inner London boroughs car ownership is often less than 50% as you rarely need one.
20	38336560	38334107	K2zep63	1	18 July 2014 10:36pm	Sadly I have trouble believing that now or alternatively I'm a tad envious.
21	38337137	38332561	Wonkothesane76	2	18 July 2014 11:01pm	Yes, they should just keep the land undeveloped as so many of us were complaining about a week ago. That would be far more preferable.
22	38337667	38333418	beadster	5	18 July 2014 11:22pm	Your garden sounds great. It makes sense as the local residents who take a keen interest in gardening can indulge and get a bit of cash off the council (???) and those that would normally have a backyard of overgrown weeds still get to enjoy a well kept outdoor space. I know what you mean but I'm sure that everyone in the area wants a 4 bedroom house with a half acre garden but with the crazy prices in the SE, this isn't possible anymore. There seems to be a serious gap in the affordable range of housing. Thanks to 1970's council flats, British people seem to be scarred mentally when it comes to apartments. I'm not suggesting they build high-rises but a development with affordable apartments for young people wanting to buy a place seems to be well needed right about now.
23	38337732	38333927	beadster	1	18 July 2014 11:25pm	I agree that people should get to live in large spacious places but unless the price of property in the UK - especially the SE - is literally halved, I don;t see any alternative.
24	38338974	38332943	Lawabider	3	19 July 2014 12:24am	Apartments == overcrowded streets.
25	38340157	38338974	beadster	6	19 July 2014 1:36am	Apartments = bustling, thriving high streets.

Most back yard developments I see these days mean populated areas are moving more towards the slums of Mumbai than anything else. Mutually assured squalor.
27	38343683	38333852	silverthread	2	19 July 2014 7:49am	Tesco taking a step in the right direction? No, they know their stores are no longer wanted, and it is an opportunity to make a lot of money. Soon other stores will follow. Large out of town shopping will get less and less popular because of internet shopping and high fuel prices. I always shop on line for most things. I may have a walk into town occasionally, but more to buy fresh produce on the market or meet friends for coffee or lunch.
28	38343808	38343683	haras99	1	19 July 2014 7:58am	and they had stock piled land!! Who is defending Tesco? I wonder if the fact they stockpiled land (for how long?) impacted in any way on the fact there was less land for other people to build new houses, fuelling the housing crisis and therefore forcing prices up? Tesco = the evil empire..
29	38346290	38335069	aquagreen	2	19 July 2014 9:45am	<blockquote>  As a country we need to learn to look at the good in something (where possible) instead of just focusing on the bad </blockquote>  Even better if if the bad is eliminated, isn't it?  Britain has the smallest houses in Europe, and shrinking. Many homes are build on the principle "minimum spending, maximum profit". As a result the end product is often sloppy, insufficient or even inadequate. Many new builds simply are made just to meet the minimum legal requirements. No ambition there from developers whatsoever. No ambitious insulation, just the bare minimum. Bathrooms and kitchens are minimally tiled or not at all sometimes. Adequate storage space is a rarity especially in apartments. 2nd and 3rd bedrooms provide just enough space to spread your arms. I could go on for ages but the conclusion is that the only ambition from developers is maximum profit , and this is  <blockquote>  standard practice </blockquote>.The final price is a "bargain" but the real joy comes when you realize how "great" leasehold tenure is if a flat is what you could afford :)  By all means, do carry on feeling positive about Tesco's initiative. I'm sure they're not the greedy type. Any home is better than nothing, even a cave. After all, living under a bridge is preferable to living under nothing, right? Let's just lighten up and... be positive! There is so much to be positive about the British housing of today! :S Give me a break.

Let's keep the greenbelt.

33	38373747	38353981	Wonkothesane76	1	20 July 2014 4:23am	Do you know how many homes will be built on greenbelt? The only site mentioned in the article, Welwyn Garden City, is a disused factory. Ugly wasteland. Do you have a problem with building much needed homes there?
34	38379392	38346290	themuse	0	20 July 2014 10:18am	If people want larger houses then why do they keep buying smaller ones? If they want more storage why buy houses/apartments without any. Everyone will continue to be greedy with profits and lazy with workmanship while ever someone is willing to pay the price.  People who are hell bent on owning a property need to ask themselves what is more important owning any property no matter how much it doesn't match their needs, or holding out to get the right property for them.   <blockquote>  Let's just lighten up and... be positive! </blockquote> How about we starting "putting money where our mouths are" as the old saying goes and stand up for what we want instead of accepting everything that is thrown at us and then having a bloody good whine about it. If Tesco build shitty shoe boxes, instead of people flocking to buy them so they can get on the "oh so brilliant property ladder" they should turn their backs on them, doubt it will happen though.....
35	38380716	38379392	aquagreen	0	20 July 2014 11:01am	<blockquote>  If people want larger houses then why do they keep buying smaller ones? </blockquote>  Because that's all they can afford.  <blockquote>  If they want more storage why buy houses/apartments without any </blockquote>  Same reason. See above.  <blockquote>  and stand up for what we want instead of accepting everything that is thrown at us and then having a bloody good whine about it. </blockquote>  For many people the only choice they have is a small, inadequate flat or not owning at all. Considering prices in London, some would need 2-3 lives in order to be able to save for a family home.  <blockquote>  people flocking to buy them so they can get on the "oh so brilliant property ladder" </blockquote>  Owning your own place is a basic human instinct; it provides a deep sense of belonging that contrubutes significantly to people's well-being. What you're suggesting is "keep saving and wait till you can buy what you want and stop moaning". Basically for many in London that would mean to save until retirement and only then if they're lucky. Some people on minimum income wouldn't be able to buy a decent home no matter how long they'd save.  As you can see, there are genuine reasons for a "a bloody good whine about it".
36	38381716	38380716	themuse	0	20 July 2014 11:33am	<blockquote>  Owning your own place is a basic human instinct; </blockquote> what a silly comment that is.

Some people on minimum income wouldn't be able to buy a decent home no matter how long they'd save. </blockquote>  Not just in London but other parts of the UK as well. I rest my case that until we as a nation make a stand and stop buying things that don't meet our requirements, just because we "must have them" nothing will change.
37	38386391	38381716	aquagreen	0	20 July 2014 2:37pm	<blockquote>  what a silly comment </blockquote>  No, silly is to deny human territoriality by saying that you "and many people who you know" don't want to own their home.

One reason they're used for is to specify where one's land begins and where it ends.   <blockquote>  you are talking utter nonsense </blockquote>  Well, if you live on planet Mars where walls and fences haven't been reported to exist, I can see why you'd be confused.

The increasing housing needs could be comfortably met, but these companies have a financial interest in keeping supply tight, and of course politicians are more interested in the corporate wellbeing than the citizen's. To make sure you don't blame them they've spun some narrative that it's that nasty old foreigner coming over here and you've fallen for it. If there was the political will this could be solved.

51	38347270	38337256	EuropeanOnion	2	19 July 2014 10:13am	It is not for private enterprise to dictate how we all live. While private enterprise is brilliant at invention and initiative it has to be kept in bounds else its natural impetus would dictate that everything must be useful else abandoned.  When you consider that some Continentals living here do not understand the concept of ducks, geese and swans as ornamental adornment, in their eyes it is food and bountifully provided, just waiting to be culled. This is the metaphor for industry. It knows no bounds; it is active and grinding and figures rather than pictures are relevant, the marks of success and the guide to the individual's competence.  If there were no rules at all, if nature is but a hindrance, if trees are just weeds and water courses inconveniences, then Britain would be just some sort of builder's yard. In the past we have seen that a balance can be obtained. But such balance is only imposed if we are in control and ahead of the game. Today we do not feel that such management is available and even if local rules forbid it then the appeal to the state will find favourable responses on merely scientific terms, measures, the reliance on fact rather than any sort of romance or quirk. Today, even if the State intervenes, there is a higher authority and not God to resort to. The EU is but a fact mountain and its difference has little understanding of Britain and its ways (it never has had), only some general, fabricated case of pan-Europeanism.  It is that thing about the search for fuel resource in a desert: pretty soon not only have you scoured the land and emptied it of the obvious fuel, the dead branches, the cow pats et al, you soon start to uproot the living stuff, the shade, the future resource, the sustenance of creatures. Pretty soon, where you started with a living desert you have a dead desert. In Britain the massive requirement of the unaffordable state has used up all the actual resource and is now setting about the fundamentals of the reflective mind, playing with our cognitive well-being by stripping away our expanse of breathing space and confining us to more and ever more claustrophobic environments. Stripping what was adornment and the unemployed, be it woodland, animals, birds, streams, aspects, our retreats and hiding places, our succour and subliminal necessity.  It is not Tesco that determines our futures. They do not determine who we are and what we aspire too. They are just another element greedy for their own place, their own survival, much in the manner of weeds. If not addressed they will rob the environment of the fruitful and needful but on their own narrow terms.

Tesco made money by selling us something we wanted. They bought land with the money and are now building things that we want on it (houses) instead of the things we don't want (more Tescos)??? And your problem is? I know there's that bit about councils building homes on the land, but which council are you thinking of that has got a land buying policy that has lost out to private enterprise? Which council is building new homes? Isn't the important point that the homes are being built? Yes, I'd prefer Santa was building them but its not realistic to imagine that is going to happen.

75	38337662	38337577	IGiveTheWatchToYou	1	18 July 2014 11:22pm	You love corporations that overcharge us and then keep their profits til they're forced to reinvest it into the community.
76	38338343	38337662	Wonkothesane76	6	18 July 2014 11:53pm	I'm not saying I love them - but there is something about 'hating' them for the right reasons. Overcharged us? How much should a tin of beans cost then? I've been happy with the price of a tin of beans I've bought from all of the big supermarkets. They've all taken the route of small profits from lots of customers, instead of bigger profits from a smaller number of customers. Are you suggesting that you want them to offer certain products at cost, or below cost in order to lower their total profits? Because then you'll only end up shrinking the market into their hands further - independents certainly won't be able to compete, and the likes of Aldi and Lidl would probably think twice about entering such a market. I get the feeling that a market completely cornered by Tesco though isn't what you want? The point is they are doing what we wanted, whether we forced them or not, and yet you still seem to be complaining. I'll repeat my original question - exactly what is it that you're not happy about??
77	38340369	38337633	johnmperry	2	19 July 2014 1:54am	Which 2m is that?
78	38340787	38337633	billcro	3	19 July 2014 2:34am	So that is the fault of Tesco then?
79	38346894	38337577	NotAgainAgain	2	19 July 2014 10:03am	<blockquote>  Tesco made money by selling us something we wanted. </blockquote>  Yes those horse meat burgers were delicious, you can't get those in Waitrose.
80	38350721	38337662	MickReid	1	19 July 2014 11:56am	You've free will, don't shop there if you don't like it.
81	38333728		Cape7441	14	18 July 2014 8:36pm	Seems a simple business decision. Tesco have land which, with changing requirements, they no longer need. How can they get a good price for it - sell it as house building development. Also gives beneficial publicity as helping to relieve well known housing shortage. What's the problem?
82	38334276	38333728	Lorfarius	24	18 July 2014 8:59pm	They aren't offering these to the staff they have on low wages.
83	38337186	38334276	hashtagthat	8	18 July 2014 11:03pm	I assume the properties will be for sale on the open market in which case they will be available to Tesco employees also. Of course they will need to obtain a mortgage like the rest of us.
84	38339519	38337186	wishyouwerehere	14	19 July 2014 12:55am	Which on wages like that will be impossible.
85	38348345	38339519	colinius	0	19 July 2014 10:45am	Wages like what?
86	38349227	38334276	Cape7441	2	19 July 2014 11:10am	They aren't offering these to the staff they have on low wages Since they aren't built you don't know that they won't - but why should they?
87	38333860		leansocialist	57	18 July 2014 8:41pm	Maybe they could build decent, affordable rented homes for their underpaid staff who currently rely on housing benefit and tax credits to get by.
88	38335624	38333860	babeldweller	14	18 July 2014 9:55pm	Extremely unlikely. Tesco is a giant business, not a charity. Britain is awash with workers who are desperate for paid work. Tesco can pick them off like cherries from a tree. In 19th century Britain there were a few employers who concerned themselves with the out of work lives of their employees, but this is the 21st century. Why would Tesco do anything that might compromise its profits?
89	38339546	38333860	wishyouwerehere	11	19 July 2014 12:57am	There is no supermarket that pays it's staff enough. Tesco is just one of many.
90	38347139	38339546	GeoffTr	2	19 July 2014 10:10am	They all pay their staff enough i.e, enough to attract & retain the quality & quantity of staff that they deem necessary. Why would a business do otherwise?
91	38333936		Thomas19999	26	18 July 2014 8:44pm	"Playing our part in meeting local housing needs "???!!!!!! I seem to have overlooked the % of social housing Tescos is building?Or does he mean for those with a £25k deposit who earn £50k+ to afford the average (not near or in London) £250K propertyAssume this need is not relevant to many of the staff Tescos employ.
92	38344111	38333936	ID581705	6	19 July 2014 8:17am	Tesco could build workhouses for their employees and pay them in tokens, to be spent in local shop. That's the spirit of the times!
93	38333989		Deja	14	18 July 2014 8:46pm	Sounds promising, but affordability is the key and Tesco's into making lots of profit, so what's the likelihood that homes will be affordable? Close to zero.
94	38334577	38333989	kimdriver	13	18 July 2014 9:11pm	If they are not affordable, they will not sell. So they will be affordable. We need homebuilding, and once we have a lot of it, homes might become affordable by your definition. Whatever that is. Inevitably, you start at the top, and move down. Nobody is going to sell a house and the land for £100,000 when similar people are queuing up to by the same for £250,000.
95	38337666	38333989	Wonkothesane76	8	18 July 2014 11:22pm	Go back to the story last week, there's a link to it in the article above. Everyone was demanding Tesco build homes, and now.......post after post of people whining about Tesco's homebuilding plan. Would you prefer they left it undeveloped?
96	38339598	38334577	wishyouwerehere	7	19 July 2014 12:59am	They will be 'affordable' to people taking on vast amounts of debt. There is the problem with the UK housing market.
97	38340413	38333989	Cynic24	11	19 July 2014 1:59am	'Affordable' has to be one of the most meaningless, bullshit terms ever dreamed up. It means absolutely nothing. Any house will be affordable to some people, but if it's supposed to mean that those on crap wages could afford it then clearly this isn't the case.
98	38343264	38334577	Deja	2	19 July 2014 7:19am	Which is just another way of saying let's keep using the same trickle down and personal debt loading that got us into trouble in the first place. I think we can be a little more creative than that.
99	38343348	38340413	Deja	0	19 July 2014 7:25am	Which is what I was saying.....
100	38334222		Lockhurst	9	18 July 2014 8:56pm	Will these new estates be known as settlements?
101	38335272	38334222	babeldweller	5	18 July 2014 9:39pm	Probably. And each new settlement will feature a Tesco Express store at the heart of the development.
102	38336042	38335272	RegionalOrganic	1	18 July 2014 10:13pm	Your local Tesco Express.
103	38336892	38336042	babeldweller	1	18 July 2014 10:50pm	Quite so. The local shop for local people.
104	38337684	38335272	Wonkothesane76	4	18 July 2014 11:23pm	Don't move there. Will that stop the whining?
