12	38228192		AlanWest81	109	16 July 2014 12:51pm	To all the non Brits reading this, this is what we call a heatwave in the UK!!
13	38228926	38228192	Madranon	10	16 July 2014 1:05pm	For several years I lived south of the Mason Dixon line with no air conditioning. I always slept well, I can't see anything a british summer can throw out stipping me sleeping. Mind you, if this is a regular occurance I'm getting flyscreens.
14	38230265	38228926	AlanWest81	8	16 July 2014 1:31pm	That makes me shudder just thinking about it. I lived in Indiana in an apartment with no air conditioning, and I had to set up 3 fans in each room blowing continuously during the summer.
15	38232626	38230265	Aliktren	2	16 July 2014 2:19pm	not being funny but wouldnt it have been cheaper to buy a portable AC ?
16	38233143	38232626	AlanWest81	1	16 July 2014 2:30pm	Fans placed around a room are better for creating a feeling of all round air conditioning.

18	38239153	38228192	RonJB	14	16 July 2014 4:59pm	Yes, I've just warned my parents, who are coming over for a visit next week. I don't know how they will cope with the heat, after fifty years in (bushfire) country Australia. They'll probably need an extra jumper. ;-)
19	38240783	38232626	madtom1999	6	16 July 2014 5:50pm	AC is not cheap to run and it tends to make you housebound as you never get used to the heat outside. Like a shit drug really.
20	38242449	38240783	vincent19	8	16 July 2014 6:50pm	nonsense. AC is the greatest invention ever devised by man. maybe beer is better, but just barely.
21	38245481	38228192	BlakeK	2	16 July 2014 8:41pm	Of course it is. The UK would have a climate similar to that of Labrador were it not for the effects of the Gulf Stream. One notes that prior to the advent of air conditioning, the British Embassy to the United States was considered a hardship post, and all personnel assigned there drew an additional pay allowance for "Tropical Duty." Here in Huntsville, Alabama the temperature is a balmy 78 degrees F (25 C) at the moment, and everybody is quite pleased with the fact that it is NOT our normal 95+ for the middle of July. (which would be 35 C.) And yes, 35 C is a normal late-summer afternoon temperature here. One gets used to it.
22	38249745	38233143	sergeberard	4	16 July 2014 11:22pm	Beg to disagree. I often observed people putting a fan in a room in the mistaken assumption that just moving the air around cools the room. It does not. A fan only works if it is directed at somebody, the wind taking off micro beads of sweat and actually causing a transfer of heat (maybe that's not well explained). A fan left in a room by itself will only warm the room further because of the engine heat. So if it's hot use a fan but turn it towards you, if you leave the room, turn it off. The only way a fan would work by itself is if you used it to bring, let's say, cool air from the basement up to the second floor.
23	38250944	38249745	AlanWest81	0	17 July 2014 12:15am	I bow to your obvious expertise on the topic. Yeah, just to clarify I meant I only had the fans running in the room I happened to be in at any one time. Re fans v portable AC, I brought a couple of pieces of kit, combined AC/heaters in one. But I found fans were far better. I guess each to their own.
24	38254283	38250944	sergeberard	0	17 July 2014 3:36am	I find A/C to be very noisy and sleeping with it, difficult. As far as the fan is concerned, my only expertise lies in the fact that I read about it somewhere, maybe in Fan Weekly or in The Daily Vent.

They were going to have a BBQ and Scottish friend lit a citronella candle to keep 'the midges' away. American friend heard her say 'midgets.' Cue interesting conversation, "What happens if they come?" "They will bite you." "And this candle will keep them away?" and so on
65	38240091	38239558	jonnie2thumbs	5	16 July 2014 5:27pm	.....and did any midgets turn up?

67	38247516	38239558	Typingmonkeys	2	16 July 2014 9:50pm	Well I am amazed that a Scottish person has found that a mere candle will see off the little buggers. I was bitten all over my shins despite wearing long thick hiking socks liberally dosed with citronella oil.

76	38267744	38228921	justask	0	17 July 2014 11:19am	Focusing on the absolute temperature so much is a mistake. The air in Britain tends to quite wet and humid, which makes heatwaves feel hotter and cold snaps feel colder. I've been in Spain when it's been 38 degrees and London at 30 degrees is worse. I've been in the Alps at -10 degrees (but dry air) and Manchester at -1 degrees feels worse.
77	38229174		retsdon	10	16 July 2014 1:10pm	If you don't have aircon - and most Britons don't - invest in a standing fan or two with good diameter blades. We don't have aircon in our house in Thailand, and although in the high 30s last month, it was bearable with decent fans.  The other trick, if it's very hot at night, is to sleep under a damp or wet bed sheet. The evaporation will cool you down. But we only do that when it's pushing 40.
78	38229601	38229174	retsdon	29	16 July 2014 1:18pm	Just an addendum. If you use a fan in the bedroom, set it to swing. Sleeping all night in a direct stream of air can leave you one hell of a sore throat in the morning.

82	38236910	38229174	MrGenius	2	16 July 2014 4:03pm	Get a ceiling fan. Best investment so far.  In the winter we set it to the opposite direction and it helps even the temperature of the room.

If you live in the UK and you're finding it too hot or, worse, muggy, the thing to do is to pop along to your local superstore and pick up a nice little 5 to 10 thousand BTU air conditioner. It won't be that expensive.  Install it in your bedroom, use it to make sure you can get a good nights sleep. Makes high temps much more bearable. Some people use fans but that doesn't get the water out of the air. Works for me over here in the US where you can get temps in the high 90s and humidity approaching 100%. (Right now we have the odd condition of 70 degrees and 100% humidity - feels really nasty even though it's not that warm.)

91	38232164	38229250	bigredroo	55	16 July 2014 2:09pm	Air conditioning in the UK is a real bug bear of mine. It's not only a complete waste of time for more than 1 week of the year but it's environmental impact is huge.  If the noise of the condenser doesn't keep you awake at night, it will certainly annoy your neighbours.  If you enjoy waking in the morning with dry and itchy eyes and a sore throat leave the a/c on overnight, but don't be surprised if your neighbour bangs on your door, demanding you move the hot air outlet pipe as the steaming hot air is blowing directly into his bedroom. I avoid restaurants and bars where you walk in and the temperature drops by 15 degrees. It doesn't get hot in this country and the fact we instantly want to chill what little warm air we have, is bizarre.

(Over here in the US stretches of weeks of 90+ degrees aren't uncommon even without climate change.) But until experience proves this to be so, feel free not to buy an AC unit. A/C noise is far less of a sleep spoiler than rolling around in a sweaty bed.  Nope, no dry and itchy eyes - just don't overdo the cooling. Of course, the UK may only have to put up with excessively hot summers for a few decades until the Gulf Stream is turned off by the huge amounts of fresh water being dumped into the Atlantic by the melting Arctic ice and Greenland glaciers - then Blighty'll wind up with a climate more like that of Labrador...

99	38229945		scrapthebbc	27	16 July 2014 1:25pm	Temperatures "set to soar". I suppose they will soon be "set to plummet".Crap journalists and other media garbage peddlers have never been able to get their heads around the seasons.

107	38247011	38229945	blairsnemesis	0	16 July 2014 9:31pm	Of course this 'heat' will last about 1 day and mainly affect the south east corner.
108	38247284	38236663	MikeRichards	1	16 July 2014 9:41pm	I like it!  The Daily Express front pages will be fabulous over the next few days as their ever-so-slightly dotty weather forecasts take prominence. (Assuming we don't have any late-breaking news about Diana or this week's miracle cure for Alzheimers/arthritis/immigration)
