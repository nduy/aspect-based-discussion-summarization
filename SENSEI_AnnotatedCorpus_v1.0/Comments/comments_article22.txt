1	38662034		MutantNinjaThinktank	208	27 July 2014 7:13am	No; we can just tax multinationals, the rich, bankers bonuses, and footballers wives - and then everything will be ok.
2	38662891	38662034	Chrispytl	82	27 July 2014 8:09am	Who are "the rich"? To some, a person earning 50k is rich. But if they rent in London and have children they won't feel at all rich. Some CIFers define rich as anyone with more money than them.
3	38663005	38662891	Sickbag	202	27 July 2014 8:14am	But then surely the same Tory mantra of "well, if you can't afford to live there you should move somewhere cheaper" applies to them as much as it does to a cleaner, binman etc, and they should uproot their families immediately?
4	38663419	38662891	chejer	53	27 July 2014 8:33am	I agree with both of your points. I don't think someone earning 50k is rich, probably below average if living in London. In my opinion we do need a more progressive tax system. There is something far wrong with our system when the super rich, by that I mean the top 1 to 10% have doubled their wealth recently while everyone else has seen their personal finances worsen. If the government focused more on tax evasion/ avoidance there wouldn't be any short fall in funding. Forcing EVERY corporation to pay their taxes based on profits made here would also make sense.
5	38663491	38662034	Dan Fox	27	27 July 2014 8:36am	Triple the NI for businesses, and lower the income tax. The NI is one tax multinationals can't avoid paying.
6	38663492	38662891	RubberDucky	4	27 July 2014 8:36am	So define rich.
7	38663687	38662891	notKnowing	3	27 July 2014 8:44am	Nope, where is the evidence?
8	38663706	38663419	Sickbag	45	27 July 2014 8:45am	There's something wrong if we have parts of our country that people on £50,000 a year can't afford to live in, I earn a decent salary, so does my partner, we're by no means poor but we couldn't afford to live in London even if we wanted to, it's an incredibly unhealthy situation
9	38663841	38662034	SaulZaentz	45	27 July 2014 8:50am	It would help if some multinationals actually paid any corporation tax for starters.
10	38663954	38662034	stripedone	24	27 July 2014 8:54am	What do want... MANSION TAX! When do we want it.... NOW!
11	38664057	38663706	uglyfruit	46	27 July 2014 8:59am	Since when, have those earning double the average wage, suddenly become entitled to the consider themselves 'not rich' or what they can't say 'poor' (because it would be unseemly) . What utter bollocks! All those out there with spread sheets of travel costs in the capital, don't bother. There are millions living weekly between £75 -£150. And they are constantly told to be grateful.
12	38664992	38664057	themuse	31	27 July 2014 9:33am	Agree you are lucky if you manage to earn anywhere near the average wage unless you work in the be all and end all of London.  I wonder how some people would manage if they had no benefits to top up their wages. For a single person earning £13,000 means you cannot get Working Tax Credit and at £15,000 housing benefits stop. Yet I am being told asking for a living wage of £18,000 is basically taking the piss out of employers! Anyone got any spare kids I can borrow?
13	38665218	38663491	nancynoonoo	8	27 July 2014 9:40am	Yes they can. They can reduce their respective workforces.
14	38666039	38662891	brian mcgovern	23	27 July 2014 10:07am	Then, by your very comments you are not rich. When you hear someone working as a contractor, they are typically paying a low tax rate - this practise is endemic in oil and gas, government outsourced contracts and higher payed staff in many large corporations.  If you have children and services are cut because of a low tax base - you will feel poorer as you will need to pay the difference. Lets not go into amazon for example, who distroy other businesses whilst paying NO TAX. Even the vat they charge goes to Luxembourg.
15	38666158	38665218	brian mcgovern	4	27 July 2014 10:10am	Or put them on contractor contracts - then no taxes are paid at all. Seriously though. Your comments are a bit stupid.

22	38679669	38663954	GreatBlah	3	27 July 2014 6:20pm	You actually want land value tax to replace council tax. That way councils would need less central government subsidy and the money could go elsewhere.
23	38687488	38662034	Oscarcat08	2	27 July 2014 10:59pm	In particular get rid of the loopholes which enable Amazon & their like to virtually avoid paying any tax in this country.
24	38662421		lokistail	322	27 July 2014 7:39am	Well, imagine if we stuck a penny on NI, and taxed the rich properly. We could have a decent NHS, plus libraries, fire service, ambulance service, SureStart, Citizens Advice, legal aid, roads without holes, sick and disabled who weren't starving, etc etc etc. It would be like living in a proper country again...
25	38662749	38662421	Sickbag	148	27 July 2014 8:01am	Haven't labour already floated the idea of an NI increase specifically for NHS spending? As for the Liberal Democrats, is anyone even listening anymore? If they ended up in another coalition with the Tories they finish off what they already started with them, selling the NHS and the British people down the river
26	38662781	38662421	laser24	40	27 July 2014 8:03am	Raising tax hurts growth and therefore in many cases actually leads to tax revenue falling. So while in theory a tax raise may sound good in reality all it will achieve is to make everyone poorer
27	38662895	38662749	EgilSkallagrimson	41	27 July 2014 8:09am	This is just the Guardian banging the drum for the LibDems. Their wet dream is that after the next election the Labour Party will have to rely on support from the tiny rump of LibDems that survive the coming apocalypse to form a government. However, I think we've already established that they don't need to have any policies in common for the LibDems to be prepared to sell their souls for a ministerial car or two.

30	38663568	38662781	chejer	30	27 July 2014 8:39am	I don't think you have to raise taxes for everyone. It could start by raising the taxes of the percentage who have doubled their wealth in the last five years, while everyone else has suffered from austerity measures. Have a look at this link. We were supposed to be "All in it together" Do you remember that statement?http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-2631817/The-rich-richer-Britains-wealthiest-worth-519billion.html
31	38663592	38662781	wheelbarrow1	33	27 July 2014 8:41am	This is an interesting idea, 'raising taxes in many cases leads to tax revenue falling'. So therefore a 10p in the £ reduction will see a huge increase in tax revenue. Why not instead pay everyone a decent living wage allowing workers a decent standard of living. How much do the taxpayers fork out to subsidies companies who exploit their workforce. It was always said that a company's main asset is its workers. Now this same workforce is seen as something to be abused with the vile Tories looking to cut closer to the bone. European human rights and 'Red tape' (health and safety) are something their fat cat donors are keen to abolish. They haven't got enough stashed away off-shore out of reach of the evil 'man/woman' in the street dependant on investment in our country. No, they must have more and more and more. There is never enough money just lying there doing nothing.

The most recent example is in Kansas where they genuinely believed that cutting tax would raise revenue and they could not have been more wrong as you can read in the NYT: Q. 'Yes, if You Cut Taxes, You Get Less Tax RevenueKansas Tax Cut Leaves Brownback With Less Money ....Kansas has a problem. In April and May, the state planned to collect $651 million from personal income tax. But instead, it received only $369 million.'

The hurdle is that it is the wealthy who have the most political influence and often eshew the very choices you list in favour of their own interests, or are their associates who have the ear of those making the decisions. And tut, tut, those with that money and power always make decisions in their own interests regardless the consequences to others.  The UK has moved as far from 'a proper country' as anyone could ever have imagined. Built in to the framework for that are the mechanisms to enable it to continue in perpetuity, all puppeted by from behind the public's view this side of the curtain.

41	38673955	38662421	Wiltie	2	27 July 2014 2:42pm	In your dreams. 1% on NI would raise £8bn. That doesn't go far when the NHS is forecast to be £30bn short soon. Quite how it manages to overspend that much on a £100bn budget is a mystery, but no doubt the minister will have an answer.
42	38674506	38664348	Arethosemyfeet	4	27 July 2014 3:05pm	It's pretty easy to demonstrate that you're wrong. When the top rate of tax was increased, more money was raised than in the previous year, and when the tax was cut again, revenue fell. Case closed. Incidentally, if you think we're on the far side of the peak, you should have fair idea of where that peak is. Care to share?

I'm not suggesting we go back to such rates now, but the message was that health and education needed to be paid for, as opposed to being provided on the cheap and for profit. And, with the higher rate band at 40% gradually pulling in more and more earners, aren't we actually seeing a return to a more realistic rate of taxation? The trouble is, no politician is prepared to be honest with the electorate about what good quality services really cost...
49	38663607	38662566	Jonathan64	22	27 July 2014 8:41am	Agreed!
50	38664354	38662566	jonbryce	32	27 July 2014 9:10am	The problem is that people won't bother to earn more money if 95% of it goes to the government. When Thatcher reduced the top rate of tax to 40%, tax revenues increased.
51	38664887	38664354	DJT1Million	64	27 July 2014 9:29am	You're forgetting that whilst income tax has been reduced, consumption taxes such as VAT have massively increased....and then there's council tax too with it's ludicrously punitive and narrow banding.  This shift has been most harshly felt by those on lower incomes as the proportion of their income they pay in taxes has risen whilst that of the 'rich', high earners, wealthy individuals & families alike and large corporates , has fallen substantially. Add into that the massive growth in tax avoidance schemes and a blind eye turned to much of the tax evasion and it all adds up to a huge problem....

When you take into account tax paid and benefits received, only about half the taxpayer population actually pays net tax. Food, water and rent don't attract VAT (which is as it should be) and the top 1% of earners pay about 28% of all the income tax, plus a huge slug of VAT on their high spending. Assuming the state needs £30bn to sort out the NHS, and with about effectively 15m taxpayers, it's only an extra £2,000 each in tax or NI. Go for it, and watch the remaining votes going down the plughole. It might be doable after an election, but not as a manifesto commitment. Then again, if it *was* a manifesto commitment, they would do the opposite after the election anyway.
59	38674623	38668321	Wiltie	4	27 July 2014 3:09pm	"There is more tax avoidance today than there ever was in the past" Absolute drivel. Don't believe the hysterical tosh in the press. HMRC has cracked down so hard that very few people try any more. The finance directors of large companies and most wealthy people I speak to are completely paranoid about their company being named and shamed because of the baying crowd of ignoramuses with pitchforks being egged on by ill-informed politicians and newspapers. The whole tax avoidance debate has been hijacked - the politicians want everyone to believe that current tax rates would be OK to fund all the services people want if only the evil tax avoiders would stop. HMRC estimated avoidance costs about £7bn and evasion £7bn. The NHS apparently needs £30bn. Go figure.

The people who do not deserve to be in government again are the Tories and the Lib Dems, who lied to the electorate.  I would be very surprised if the electorate fall for any Lib Dem promise in 2015.

71	38662631		SirMarky	131	27 July 2014 7:53am	Isn't National Insurance a NHS tax? In their constant race to the bottom on taxation and services they seem to have forgotten this. Raise NI and fill the gap.
72	38662847	38662631	Sickbag	75	27 July 2014 8:06am	I'm sure the Labour Party were suggesting exactly that pretty recently, although the Liberals could never be seen to agree with Labour, just like the bedroom tax that they now oppose but wouldn't vote against, or the mansion tax that they liked until labour suggested one, so they come up with some bollocks about an NHS tax, which they'd drop anyway if they went into another coalition with the Tories, because they are unprincipled whores who will do anything to stay in government
73	38662959	38662631	DomesticExtremist	108	27 July 2014 8:12am	Correct - sadly the Toxic Tories have branded it a jobs tax and cut it back.It's almost as if they wanted to bankrupt the NHS, for some reason.
74	38663539	38662631	RubberDucky	18	27 July 2014 8:38am	Getting the likes of Google, Vodaphone, Amazon, Microsoft, Starbucks etc should be paying their fair share before any personal taxes are increased. We are already effectively subsidising them.
75	38664435	38662631	jonbryce	4	27 July 2014 9:13am	No, National Insurance is supposed to pay for benefits and state pension, not the NHS, however social security costs are about £12bn higher than the money received from National Insurance so some of that money is spent from other sources.
76	38665050	38662631	whitehorseview	10	27 July 2014 9:35am	No. We collectively pay £106bn in NI per year. £85bn is spent on benefits earned by paying NI (97% of that is state pensions). £21bn is diverted to the NHS. Total social security spend is £180bn (including all the means-tested benefits that have nothing to do with NI, paid for out of taxes). On top of that, the state pays out £21bn in tax credits (social security with a different label on it, also paid for out of taxes). NHS England has a budget of about £95bn on top of that, so about 20% of NHS funding comes from NI. 1% on employers' and employees' NI, when Gordon Brown imposed it in 2003, raised about £8bn for the NHS. Thresholds are now higher, so it might raise a bit less if they did it again (assuming nobody lost their job because of the extra cost loaded onto employers, which is far from a given).
77	38665166	38664435	DJT1Million	8	27 July 2014 9:38am	National Insurance doesn't pay for the whole of the NHS however it does pay towards some of it, it is not just for benefits and state pension as you claim.
78	38665471	38662847	oohyabuggerata	12	27 July 2014 9:49am	Yes, the Lib Dems voted for the Bedroom Tax and have been defending it for 3 years until about a couple of weeks ago. Could that have anything to do with an election looming nearer?
79	38665964	38665166	jonbryce	1	27 July 2014 10:04am	For the year 2012-13, the government collected £103.8bn from National Insurance receipts - http://www.publicspendingfacts.co.uk/tag/breakdown-of-tax-revenues-in-uk/ and spent £114bn on Social Security, £139bn on State Pensions, and £124bn on health care - http://www.ukpublicspending.co.uk/breakdown_2013UKbt_14bc5n
80	38668707	38664435	Reduced	5	27 July 2014 11:29am	<blockquote>  No, National Insurance is supposed to pay for benefits and state pension, not the NHS </blockquote>  In 1947 the act dealing with National insurance was changed to include payments to the NHS. A portion of the receipts from National insurance have been transferred to the NHS ever since. I'm afraid you are talking bollocks!
81	38669132	38665964	Reduced	6	27 July 2014 11:43am	<blockquote>  and spent £114bn on Social Security </blockquote>  The National insurance fund only pays contribution based benefits, the first six months of unemployment benefit to those who have contributed NI payments for two years. It doesn't pay income based benefits such as income based job seekers allowance, tax credits or any other benefit. It pays towards contribution based pensions, it doesn't pay towards the income based level of pensions or pension credits. Until 2009 the National insurance fund was in surplus. During recessions it's accepted that it may go into the red and we are just coming out of a recession. The website you linked to is not correct in stating that National Insurance is a tax. To be a tax it would have to be available for general government expenditure. In fact the funds are spent on very specific areas. Any surplus in the fund is borrowed by the Government and repaid with 8% interest!
82	38674435	38665471	bitthick	3	27 July 2014 3:02pm	Labour are no better than the Lib Dems on this: the only tiny difference is that they beat them to the same trick by a few months. Labour voted for the bedroom tax too, and defended it for some months afterwards -- to the extent that in Holyrood, Labour voted no less than five different times to kybosh the Scottish government's attempts to mitigate the effects of the bedroom tax . They insisted that the Scottish government did not have the right to set aside the £40m they found in the budget to pay it. Even though the devolution settlement is explicit that all powers not explictly retained are devolved. Labour in Scotland finally got Labour in London to understand how unpopular it was making SLab, and stopped opposing the SG measure -- as long as the SG agreed to go cap in hand to Westminster and ask for special permission to pay the tax communally. Labour immediately tweeted that they had "saved Scotland from the council tax" that they voted for. And of course, Labour councils continue to evict the vulnerable people who fall into rent arrears as a result. The three shades of shite are only distinguishable by their timing.
83	38674991	38662631	colbristol	3	27 July 2014 3:27pm	If you look at the rates and thresholds for NI you will see that anyone who earns more than about £42,000 per annum pays just 2% NI on everything above that amount.If there were ever a fair and reasonable means to address the NHS funding crisis, then surely removing the higher earners NI subsidy is it.
84	38662643		davidabsalom	121	27 July 2014 7:54am	Who cares what the LibDems think? They'll just rip up their policies and do what their told by the majority coalition partner if they ever get near to power again.
85	38664705	38662643	ricmondo	4	27 July 2014 9:23am	Why don't you attempt to understand what is suggested rather than resorting to knee jerk cliche.

87	38665501	38664705	oohyabuggerata	38	27 July 2014 9:50am	Because he has a modicum of intelligence and won't fall for the Lib Dem spin.
88	38671463	38662643	outofit	7	27 July 2014 1:03pm	Also, I would imagine that this time, if they do get in a coalition government they will have far fewer MPs and will not have anything like the power of veto that they tell us they have been exercising during this last 4 years and have thus been able to water down the Tory's policies! They will have to do exactly what they are told, and they will do it if it means they have a place in government! They really are quite shameless!
89	38677932	38664705	Dubdemon	6	27 July 2014 5:20pm	Because just like me and many others, he doesn't believe a fucking word they say.
90	38662648		SybilSanderson	64	27 July 2014 7:54am	<blockquote>  should there be coalition negotiations in 2015. </blockquote> Oh no you wont, Labour. If you even hint that you might go into coalition with LibDems, you can waive any support goddbye.
91	38662737	38662648	Knowles2	9	27 July 2014 8:01am	So far polls are pointing to no overall majority again in Parliament, so all three parties are laying down their priorities for any coalition that is formed, probably a lot more in private than they are in public.
92	38662887	38662737	Sickbag	44	27 July 2014 8:08am	UK Polling report give Labour a majority of 44, it's veered between that and around 80 for quite some time now
93	38679031	38662648	tonyp1	3	27 July 2014 5:56pm	Absolutely. Please remember this: Vote Labour, get neo-liberal, free market deregulation, work casualisation and the commercialisation and asset stripping of everything, including the NHS. And the exponentially increasing gap between the rich and the rest of us will only continue to accelerate. I recognise that this puts anyone who believes that voting is a civic duty, rather than a democratic right you can exercise or not, in a predicament. It goes without saying that I'm not recommending the arch, extreme neo-liberals of UKIP, or any other of the ultra-right factions, but something radically different.
94	38662681		AndrewStaden	24	27 July 2014 7:57am	Total nonsense. Administering any tax costs a fortune and the party is proposing to create a new when we already have mechanisms for hundreds of taxes. All this is because all parties are scared of raising income tax percentages; and income tax takes money from those most able to pay without hitting those least able to pay. Another fatuous idea.
95	38665047	38662681	Longwoodsy	18	27 July 2014 9:35am	Not to mention that the £30 Billion black hole is just a small part of cost of privatisation and assorted PFI scams.

99	38662721		WalterBMorgan	38	27 July 2014 8:00am	We need to have an income tax and national insurance system that clearly shows how tax funds are used for health and welfare services. The principle of what you pay in is reflected in what you can take out is important. The NHS benefits from being clearly something we all pay for according to means generally and take out as misfortune dictates. This same approach in general needs to be applied to social care, unemployment and sickness benefit etc. The idea that these benefits are only for the helpless and feckless needs to be banished. A system that improves care or income level in the case of misfortune and with some reflection upon the extent of contribution would help restore the idea that if you are without income for a few months you won't simply be put on a subsistence only diet and treated as a layabout when you've clearly paid in and therefore can clearly take out.
100	38664730	38662721	ricmondo	2	27 July 2014 9:24am	A good definition of the suggested hypothication.
