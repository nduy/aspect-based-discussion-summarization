1	37723145		borris14	42	03 July 2014 11:21am	Older workers will generally have lower housing costs as their mortgage will have been paid off. Therefore there is less incentive and need to earn more. They won't feel worse off at all, probably far from it. And as the article rightly says, many will be thinking about retiring.
2	37723933	37723145	ridcully24	36	03 July 2014 11:39am	I definitely feel worse off and I am. Started work in late 70s, have secured appropriate qualifications -even invested in some more this year. I think of retiring and know I never will. Got mortgage in 2006, (post grad and appropriate qualifications for two sectors) and provide home for self and two students. I have applied for hundreds of jobs with necessary experience and qualifications to match, or more usually exceed stated requirements. Thanks to linkedin, I get to see how they prefer younger people for the roles. I have struggled for jobs in a number of recessions as primarily worked in the privater sector but this the worst.  I am earning less now than I did in 1990 and will be hoping for a step up by queuing at one of Aldi's infamous open day's for new staff this Saturday.

5	37724295	37723950	LouiseHR	10	03 July 2014 11:47am	Exactly. Because, believe me, given the choice I'd be working more and earning more. The fact my mortgage is paid off has allowed me to continue in my home, though it's a struggle and we may have to sell.
6	37724891	37723145	Katesdad0	14	03 July 2014 12:00pm	"Therefore there is less incentive and need to earn more." Bit of a sweeping generalisation. Many of us still have the costs of adult kids living at home, or are using retirement savings to help them find a place of their own. Not all older workers own, those that rent have seen rents increase while wages have at best stagnated. Of those that do own, many have seen their wages eaten up by inflation and low/no wage increases. None of this is new to anyone, all of us, young and old are in the same boat, stagnant wages and increasing living costs. Stop polarising.
7	37725825	37724891	borris14	7	03 July 2014 12:20pm	<blockquote>  Stop polarising </blockquote>  There is more to the cost of living than simply wages, as discussed in the recent JRF articles. Housing costs are a crucial factor. The article implies that older people are worse off because they earn less. I'm simply saying that because their housing costs will generally be lower than a younger person buying today then they are probably not worse off at all when you factor this in. Most people just want a comfortable standard of living, and are not driven by a desire to get rich. If you have no housing costs and commuting costs then you could probably live quite comfortably on £1000 a month.

Others are just building debts on 0% credit card deals that will be paid off from their estate.

Sure, some of us will never be millionaires because of background and social circles but there really is nothing stopping anyone in this country earning decent standard of living so that they're not poor. People do have a choice. Really.
15	37723953		ThornburyBoy	16	03 July 2014 11:40am	Contributors often comment that the older generation had an easier time - lower price housing etc. this article suggests that whilst housing may be more expensive, later generations have had greater earnings though many chose to spend on consumer goods instead of housing.

The big difference a decade of low interest rates and no chance of them rising soon. Those buying houses in the north have a great deal thats why mortgages are less than rents. Those starting work in the seventies had interest rates at ten percent to sixteen percent most of their mortgages. So heres a test for you go and find out how much each of those interest rates would make a repayment mortgage of 100k . Go on line and put in the numbers it would bloody shock the lot of you.
18	37728024	37726852	Turnbull2000	27	03 July 2014 1:06pm	<blockquote>  Those starting work in the seventies had interest rates at ten percent to sixteen percent most of their mortgage </blockquote>  And the price of the house would be fraction it was now - so repayments as a proportion of income wouldn't be that massive at 10% interest rates.  Furthermore, incomes were often rising by double digits too, so the mortgage burden was greatly reduced after just 4-5 years. Today, house prices are high, interest rates as low as they'll get, and salary growth is almost non-existent - thus mortgages will remain a heavy burden for 15-20 or more.

So, in normal times, a house cost about the same as one year's take home pay for a median family..... more in London, often x 2. Outside the South East it now costs about 8 years local net pay, in the South East 12 years, and in London about 16 years. These ratios are well above those operating in 1987 .... which was followed in 1988 and 1989 with a property value crash in the order of 50% in many places.

27	37725412	37724270	Meerkat_5	17	03 July 2014 12:11pm	What do you mean by wrong and right and what do you mean by choices?  Some people have the 'choice' to be born into a situation which affords them certain perks. Most other people do not have that choice.  Apparently I made the latter choice, which in hindsight was the wrong choice. My parents made the wrong choice to be unable to be educated fully due to the cost of education so instead made the wrong choice of living off rice and beans while working in subsistence jobs. My father made the right choice to be a hard worker who was eventually recognised and so became a supervisor.  Some choices you can make and some choices are forced on you, some choices are 'right' and some are not but you can never know which it will be until afterwards. I dropped out of university which ended up being the right choice but at the time looked like the wrong choice.

31	37726920	37726383	C LS	9	03 July 2014 12:44pm	Quite. Or, to put it in even simpler terms - good luck affects most people in one of two ways: The first group try to conceal their good luck by making up nonsense about the unlucky to make it seem like the unlucky made and deserve the bad luck and they can keep their winnings, guilt-free. The second group don't even understand that they're lucky but instead believe every bit of guff they trump out of their mouths. Well, It worked for me. And I'm great!  Incidentally, I believe the second group is more typically your champagne socialists and the first are your straight ahead Tories.
32	37744336	37724270	nondescrpt	2	03 July 2014 7:38pm	<blockquote>  Take responsibility and stop blaming external forces </blockquote>  So when crops fail in, say, South Sudan all they have to do, in order not to starve, is to make some of those 'right choices.'

33	37771267	37724270	olderiamthelessiknow	1	04 July 2014 1:24pm	Most adults make the right choices by luck as do those making the wrong choices (bad luck) . It has very little indeed to do with a superior mindeset of one group over the anorther.  Unless you have had good luck. In that case wrap it up in smugness.

37	37726961	37725026	thriftynot	4	03 July 2014 12:45pm	Again you must work in the public sector if you think you get big redundancy payments and anything more than a state pension.

University Grants were mean tested, and once graduates completed their Undergraduate Training, and commenced employment, the graduate employee returned a fair payment to the system through tax and higher productivity.

I reject the burden which is being imposed on the current generation of University Students, and hopefully a future Labour Government on the one hand will terminate with expediency the £9K Liberal Tuition Fee, and insist that the Liberals repay the £2.4M donation from Convicted Fraudster Michael Brown.

48	37734644	37732465	Billlogan	1	03 July 2014 3:11pm	Only grants were means tested and rather loosely at that, but there was no tuition fee.

54	37727664	37724677	shebunkin	22	03 July 2014 1:00pm	i started work in 1971 aged 17. I earned £48 a month gross in the civil service which had a very large incremental scale in those days, so young workers were paid a lot less than older colleagues doing the same work. i was in my late 40s/early 50s before my salary (having left the civil service) hit the average earnings figure. i purchased my house in 1981 and was shortly afterwards hit by raised interest rates of 15%. clothing and white goods were, relative to today's prices, very much more expensive eg a washing machine would cost 1 months salary. the rise in mortgage payments was a big struggle - can remember when i had a choice between buying a new dishcloth or a lightbulb, but couldn't afford to buy both. i was a single parent, with child-minder fees to pay - no help there at that time. the time in my 50s when i was earning decent money, and my daughter was at university (she fell for the first year of student loans) was pretty short lived. in 2007, with the end of my mortgage in sight, i re-mortgaged so that i could help my daughter pay off some of her student debt, a decision i made due to her circumstances. in 2009 my employer, a voluntary organisation was in financial difficulties, and for a year we didn't know when we would be paid, or how much of our salary would be paid, until the organisation collapsed in to insolvency in October 2010. i was lucky enough to transfer, with my project to a partner organisation, but part time - 3and a half days a week, instead of full time, and took a £500 a month pay cut. just under 2 years later i was made redundant due to legal aid reforms destoying my profession, 18 months shy of age 60, and 3 months away from finally clearing my mortgage on my 2 bedroom starter home. i had known for a long time that i was in the transitional group of women affected by the equalisation of pension age and wouldn't receive my state pension until the age of 63 and 9 months, but this has now been increased to 65 and 3 months. i've pretty much lived hand to mouth throughout my 41 year working life, and although i now own my little house, i will not make any profit on it - the main charge against baby-boomers - i obviously have very bad timing and keep missing boats. having reached 60, i now live on my small civil service pension and am reconciled to my reduced circumstances, since being unfairly sanctioned by the jobcentre over christmas 2012, which caused me to give up looking for work. my income has fallen from over £26,000 in 2010 to £8000.
55	37727937	37727091	MELSM	5	03 July 2014 1:05pm	Yes, they should make their own pension contributions... ...hang on, they do, don't they?
56	37728276	37727937	thriftynot	3	03 July 2014 1:11pm	Yes they make contributions. Now compare that to a private pension. That has had to half annuity rates to account for longevity. Go check out how other schemes work. There is already 1 trillion pound shortfall that is being topped up by billions per year in taxes. Its time the taxpayer was let off the hook.

Anyone with pension savings can access them from age 55, not just the public sector. Normal retirement age in the current civil service pension scheme is 65, and will be linked to state pension age in the new scheme from April 2015.  I'm in favour of both changes, but it's wrong to say that older workers don't have a significantly better deal in terms of state pension access or that public sector workers can access their pensions any earlier than anyone else can.

68	37726411	37726034	Yeokel	8	03 July 2014 12:33pm	That will be the RTB that was bought in during the '80s by Thatcher will it, not during the '70s which is the time that this article is referring to?
69	37727024	37726411	C LS	4	03 July 2014 12:47pm	Oh yes, good point. People starting work in 1975 staring to buy a home in 1985. Well, that's just a ridiculous idea. Thanks for pointing out my silly position. Jesus wept
70	37727147	37724951	thriftynot	1	03 July 2014 12:49pm	My house bought in 1979 for 11750 is now worth just 125000. So whats the bonus after years of huge interest rates?
71	37727198	37725955	alanredangel	1	03 July 2014 12:50pm	But their mortgage was a lot lower relative to income, and they consumed less.
72	37728142	37725945	scrotgrot	4	03 July 2014 1:08pm	Sure, but it's a bed of your own collective making, the having to support adult children. While you whine about working at 60, my generation doesn't entertain the merest expectation of retiring before 75. We may end up living longer but presumably most of it will be spent sitting around in soiled nappies with dementia - and that's if we're lucky enough to afford the medical bills.
73	37728828	37728142	richardha28	7	03 July 2014 1:22pm	And reading you whining about it makes me believe that you don't deserve anything better.
74	37729164	37726034	richardha28	3	03 July 2014 1:28pm	Ah diddums - I can hear the world's smallest violin and its playing just for you. The reality is that proportionally speaking very few benefited from RTB and most who did had paid rent on their council house for many years that was the equivalent of what a mortgage payment would have been. However I'm sure your over developed sense of entitlement won't allow you to comprehend that.
75	37734328	37729164	StrawberryTart	0	03 July 2014 3:05pm	You sound lovely
76	37740944	37729164	C LS	0	03 July 2014 5:41pm	What utter guff. I am quite literally a man who has no sense of entitlement at all. I have been brought up in an environment that tells me I deserve nothing because of who my parents were and the year I was born.  You sound like Bono wondering why there isn't a strong music industry any more. And then deciding it must be because musicians these days just don't have the passion, man.
77	37747784	37726411	GreatBlah	0	03 July 2014 9:38pm	RTB started earlier than that. It was a labour policy.

Having one doesn't cancel out the others.

84	37726737	37725452	theonionmurders	14	03 July 2014 12:40pm	I'm not so sure. Beyond the frantic right-wing headlines national debt was reduced more than in any other decade,we were more equal, a house in my local area cost little over 1.5 times average salary for a skilled worker, and there were more jobs available. Industrial action never amounted to more than one day per worker, per year lost.  The asset stripper's and financiers simply responded to a squeeze caused by a temporary oil shock and took their chance to parasitically feed off the commonweal. With backing in the press, think-tanks and the PR industry they managed to pull it off and convince us we were all richer by selling off assets and taking out credit rather than run an industrial policy- a consequence we are living with today and only just beginning to digest it's ramifications.
85	37729438	37726737	theonionmurders	3	03 July 2014 1:32pm	Also, what really surprised me was that UK growth of output per head was also much higher then too, even inspit of two 'oil shocks' - how could that possibly be the case when dergulation and privatisation always promised us otherwise. <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1TYJSR-o7zU/UBM0CCV9o1I/AAAAAAAAGGc/7pnLOAYQfoU/s1600/Real%2BGDP%2Bper%2BCapita%2BGrowth.jpg" rel="nofollow">But what did we get instead?</a> First regime , 1960s to mid 1970s : 3% per capita. This was when wages grew along with productivity across the income distribution , and debt/gdp levels were low and stable. Second regime , late 1970s to ~2005 : 2% per capita. Wage growth no longer linked to productivity , increasing inequality and growing private debt/gdp burdens across the economy. Third regime , 2009-present : ~0.7% per capita. Same crummy wages , but debt/gdp has stabilized , so this is probably what the second regime would have looked like without the debt turbocharge or North Sea oil. You'd think that we'd be rushing to re-implement the system of the first regime , the one that gave us more than 4x the rate of real per capita gdp growth than we're getting today.

87	37736966	37725452	maximilienrobespiere	2	03 July 2014 4:03pm	a damn sight better to have been a teenager back in the 1970's than now, I know as I was in the group in question - adjusted for inflation I was making more money in 1978 at 19 years of age than I do now! 1979 and the rise to power of Ding-Dong wasn't known as YEAR ZERO for nothing!!
88	37725699		WhistlingNeil	6	03 July 2014 12:17pm	If the journalist cannot be bothered to actually do more than this then frankly - an article saying, ONS report on labour market history published you can read it (link here), would be just about as informative.  Why won't this newspaper do what papers are supposed to do actually inform their readers rather than simply picking a headline worthy of the Daily Mail to misinform them.
89	37734725	37725699	RedGiant23	2	03 July 2014 3:13pm	Have to agree. Its about clickbait now. A big suggestive headline and no actual article as long as you have an opinion and come on here they have done their job.  Wonder if they will an article on the decline in quality journalism?
90	37725827		Yeokel	13	03 July 2014 12:20pm	What's with all the anti-50s and over ire in many of these posts? This is a newspaper article based on a report by the Office for National statistics and yet you young 'us are having a go at us oldies as though we're rampaging against our lot.  We were born when we were born, some have done better than others and some will have a better or longer retirement than others. We don't need all the crap being thrown at us in these comments.
91	37726352	37725827	C LS	5	03 July 2014 12:31pm	I think you'll find, if you are able to be honest, that all the "anti-50s" comments are responses/replies to all the pathetic comments from your lot, saying - see, it ain't so peachy. This proves it etc, there's virtually no difference between having a 60k mortgage and paying a grand a month in rent.
92	37727019	37725827	Elbowpatch	14	03 July 2014 12:46pm	<blockquote>  What's with all the anti-50s and over ire in many of these posts? </blockquote>  This is found all over the internet. The main reason is to do with the fact so many of you sit smugly a-top a huge pile of property equity (and yes many could downsize to a nice house and still have masses left over). Here in Herts land reg figures show 5 bed detached homes selling for under £5000 in 1971, so about 2 or 3 times the annual wage. Now those same fairly standard homes are £700k, about 20 times ave' income.
93	37727300	37727019	thriftynot	5	03 July 2014 12:53pm	Well try finding those same figures in Hill Doncaster, Bradford, wigan, blackpool do you want me to go on ? We don t all live in the southeast. Even in Newham youll find property that has generally only gone up equivalent do wage inflation. Whilst interest rates have dramatically gone down.
94	37727460	37727019	Yeokel	3	03 July 2014 12:56pm	<blockquote>  The main reason is to do with the fact so many of you sit smugly a-top a huge pile of property equity </blockquote>  So many?Maybe in the SE, but I would suggest that if you were to venture north of Watford, or west of Salisbury you might well see a different picture.  <blockquote>  Here in Herts.... </blockquote> Well, you could always move you know.  And your comparison of Average Income is flawed.There is a huge difference in Average Income between the SE and the rest. So, your £700k = 20x Ave might be true for the country as a while, but it isn't true for many who live in the likes of Herts, is it?
95	37727836	37727300	scrotgrot	6	03 July 2014 1:03pm	In the 70s there were jobs in those areas.
96	37728387	37727836	thriftynot	2	03 July 2014 1:14pm	When did they decline was it last year ? or could it have been in the eighties when interest rates were 16% wake up you twits.
97	37729516	37727019	richardha28	3	03 July 2014 1:33pm	"so many of you sit smugly a-top a huge pile of property equity" Yup that's right - and the reason many of us do this is because it really irritates self righteous whingers who blame everyone but themselves for their standard of living, have an over developed sense of entitlement and believe that houses were just being given away to anyone who wanted one in the 70s and 80s.

Could not fine anythng in Watford, Hemel, Stevenage, Hitchen. I had to commute to London, not ideal at all. I can only assume you are quoting a hamlet somewhere near Huntingdon, or are you fibbing?

100	37739038	37730686	walkinginthesand	0	03 July 2014 4:54pm	Computer hiccup. Was just saying thanks for clarification on numbers, I thought they were a bit odd.
101	37761922	37727019	thebiker	0	04 July 2014 9:27am	The thing about 5 bed detached homes - only a very small percentage of the population live in one.The thing about generally high house prices - they don't do the house owner much good unless you're a last time seller (dead, or need to sell to pay the nursing home fees) or you're trading down, or you're going for equity release to top up an inadequate annuity.
