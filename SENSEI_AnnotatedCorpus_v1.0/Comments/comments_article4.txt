1	37777296		Tenthred	144	04 July 2014 4:04pm	If the aircraft carrier shows why Scotland needs to be part of a unitary UK state, you'll need to remind me of the precise significance of the Eurofighter Typhoon in the context of EU integration.
2	37777679	37777296	RabbitLeader	130	04 July 2014 4:16pm	Because developing advanced fighter aircraft is hugely more expensive than building a ship. If Scotland chooses independence, Scottish taxpayers are perfectly welcome to build their own ships at Rosyth to maintain jobs.....but don't expect UK to continue supporting jobs in an independent Scotland whilst Salmond proposes to steal jobs from the North of England with cuts in corporation tax and punish UK students studying in Scotland.
3	37777779	37777296	davser	35	04 July 2014 4:19pm	Exactly.
4	37777808	37777679	TommyG50	32	04 July 2014 4:20pm	You should know by now these contracts go to the Best Bid and the best quality Build .
5	37777885	37777808	RabbitLeader	23	04 July 2014 4:22pm	No they don't!
6	37778062	37777808	RabbitLeader	37	04 July 2014 4:27pm	No they don't. BAE owns shipyards in Scotland and Portsmouth.....those contracts won by BAE could have been allocated to Portsmouth 100% and no doubt BAE won those contracts because the ships would be built in the UK. The only difference in future is that future Royal Navy ships will be built at Portsmouth should Scotland vote for independence. If you believe Salmond, there are no negative consequences for voting for independence. Yup, no lies there!
7	37778229	37778062	Tenthred	45	04 July 2014 4:32pm	So incredibly expensive, by the time anyone even thinks of a project that size again I just don't think there will be any question of a single European state attempting it other than in collaboration if at all. The days of the Big National Statement are over, and they seem to have ended in rather a muddle.
8	37779183	37777679	EpicNinjaCowboy	42	04 July 2014 5:02pm	<blockquote>  whilst Salmond proposes to steal jobs from the North of England with cuts in corporation tax </blockquote>  Baffling. It's perfectly legitimate to set your own corporation tax if you're a sovereign state. rUK has the ability to match or beat it if they deem fit. This kind of complaining can be done to your elected representative who can take your wishes to anachronistic Westminster to sort out.  It's not for your hypothetical neighbouring nation to disadvantage themselves for the betterment of your economy. This is an argument that I've heard time and time again against iScotland, one that I agree with and one that works both ways.

10	37779387	37778062	NYorkie	18	04 July 2014 5:09pm	BAE owns shipyards in Scotland and Portsmouth.....those contracts won by BAE could have been allocated to Portsmouth  Indeed they could so the question is why under the Union, they weren't? You are right to suggest that future ships could be built in Portsmouth but there is an associated premium and disruption for so doing.  That may of course be politically acceptable / desirable.
11	37779591	37777679	NYorkie	8	04 July 2014 5:17pm	Because developing advanced fighter aircraft is hugely more expensive than building a ship Its not just development costs, production costs and through life costs that impact upon the decision. Economies of scale suggest you get cheaper aircraft, including through life support costs by building more of them and you can only do that by equipping multinational air-forces. Euro-fighter is likely to be the last combat aircraft developed and manufactured solely in Western Europe - numbers purchased/ planned have already been cut BAE SYSTEMS has been re jigging it's business for the last 20 + years given the inevitable demise/ reduction in business significance of military airframe development and manufacture.
12	37779598	37777679	Bulington	49	04 July 2014 5:17pm	<blockquote>  Scottish taxpayers are perfectly welcome to build their own ships at Rosyth to maintain jobs </blockquote>  There are no more MOD contract ships being built in the forseeable future other than what is already being built.So what do you think will happen to those jobs currently at Rosyth? Westminster will keep them going until September the 19th with false promise of more defence contracts then they will be made redundant, yes or no. The union has nothing more to offer Scotland except poverty and unemployment.
13	37779770	37779183	RabbitLeader	12	04 July 2014 5:25pm	What is baffling is Salmond making outrageous claims to revitalising the Scottish economy based on lower corporation tax that would not invite a retaliatory cut in tax from the UK...... Don't you think under this scenario, this can only be damaging? One might also infer that Holyrood is anachronistic. It only has yes committees for scrutineering the Scottish government.
14	37779789	37777808	Rudeboy1	6	04 July 2014 5:25pm	Not contracts for warships....under EU procurement rules warships are exempt. If we wanted the best price we could buy Arleigh Burkes from the US.
15	37779941	37779770	HulloHulot	28	04 July 2014 5:31pm	<blockquote>  What is baffling is Salmond making outrageous claims to revitalising the Scottish economy based on lower corporation tax that would not invite a retaliatory cut in tax from the UK...... </blockquote>  You mean like the retaliatory corporation tax cut the UK implemented when Ireland went to 12.5%? The one which didn't happen?
16	37780005	37779598	TheGreatRonRafferty	51	04 July 2014 5:34pm	Strange that people are getting all pompous about building two aircraft carriers, when this government has placed an order for FOUR large ships for the RFA in South Korea. Presumably South Korea is part of the rUK, so it's OK to support THEIR shipyards, but not the ones up the road? Bizarre.
17	37780037	37779598	Rudeboy1	12	04 July 2014 5:36pm	Apart from the Type 26 Frigate Programme of 13 vessels.....the POW also has to be finished. If the independence referendum returns a no vote Rosyth will go from QNLZ and POW build to the T26 programme. There has to be substantial investment in the yard, but it is entirely dependent on the referendum outcome. I don't mind either way if Scotland votes yes or no, but for Rosyth the outcome is clear as day. A No vote means closure after POW is completed, a Yes votes means a future beyond that.
18	37780071	37780005	Rudeboy1	9	04 July 2014 5:38pm	No UK yards bid believe it or not, which was a tragedy. As RFA ships as well if we'd wanted to we could have slapped some guns on them, designated them as warships instead of auxiliaries, and made them exempt from EU procurement rules as well (which is what everyone else does). It's likely that the next batch of RFA MARS ships will be on order for them as well, unless someone makes a bid.
19	37780133	37779387	Rudeboy1	7	04 July 2014 5:41pm	BAe and HMG have been entirely clear on this, that in the event of a Yes vote that is what the outcome will definitely be. It's probably the clearest issue in the independence debate. The SNP position that the UK would continue to build them in Rosyth is nonsense as a large government investment is needed in the yard for the T26 programme.
20	37780188	37780005	Bangorstu	6	04 July 2014 5:44pm	Whereas I agree those ships should have been built here, they're not warships, nor are they part of the Royal Navy. So a bit of a red herring.
21	37780277	37780071	TheGreatRonRafferty	13	04 July 2014 5:47pm	Yes, all that info is available, and I read it. However, the principle appears to be that warships - and the RFAs ARE warships by any sensible definition - will be built in the UK. Now, like spolit kids, we're suggesting that warships can be built in Korea, but can't be built in the UK! The "no-bidder" from the UK is of course bollocks. How else do we get warships built only in the UK? The politicians are tying themselves in knots (npi).
22	37780346	37780188	TheGreatRonRafferty	13	04 July 2014 5:50pm	<blockquote>  Whereas I agree those ships should have been built here, they're not warships, nor are they part of the Royal Navy.    So a bit of a red herring.  </blockquote>  You see this is the "let's define a Royal Navy ship as something else" Monty Python approach to politics. On the other hand, I was thinking of holidaying on one of the new Korean ships, but only if P&O aren't using it for refuelling one of their cruise ships with it at the time.
23	37780446	37777808	Happytravelling	6	04 July 2014 5:54pm	<blockquote>  You should know by now these contracts go to the Best Bid and the best quality Build . </blockquote>  And we all know, by your statement above, that you don't have a clue. Government, strategic spending goes where it likes. It could have made these carriers in Italy or Korea. The UK gov chose the Clyde because it was strategically important to keep the money and skills within the UK. If Scotland votes for independence, it will no longer qualify for rUK strategic spending. BAe will be paid to modify other docks, as it was paid to modify the docks on the Clyde. Even Salmond wasn't stupid enough to make comments like you have, as it is fairly obvious, by the strong union statements etc., he knew it would lack any credibility.
24	37780541	37780277	Rudeboy1	6	04 July 2014 5:58pm	The no bidder was partly due to capacity in the yards, but also was due to the fact that as the competition was opened up (as they weren't designated as warships, which is factually correct and is applying the letter of EU law correctly, despite the fact that no-one else does it) no-one would stand a chance on price competing with a Korean yard as they are way cheaper due to the vast economy of scales they have. they're also much more used to building this type of vessel on a regular basis. The design is still British though, we're still good at that bit.Which really leads us to the point, if the rUK didn't transfer naval shipbuilding to Portsmouth in the event of a Yes vote, and then allowed Rosyth to tender for ship building programmes (which also won't be as big). They still wouldn't get the work as they would be competing with other cheaper shipbuilders (the Koreans incidentally make some fine warships). Either way Rosyth is finished in the event of a Yes vote, it couldn't compete on warship contracts and it already can't compete on merchant ship building.
25	37780649	37780346	Happytravelling	12	04 July 2014 6:02pm	<blockquote>  You see this is the "let's define a Royal Navy ship as something else" Monty Python approach to politics. </blockquote>  And the willful denial of the obvious "Chamberlain" approach to politics is prevelant again! Even somebody as deliberately obtuse as yourself can see the difference between a tanker and a capital ship? The Royal Navy deliberately builds capital ships in the UK, to retain skills, technology etc. If Scotland ceases to be part of the UK, it will lose capital ship orders from the rUK. Its really very obvious and simple. I don't get why you keep trying to pretend it is not so. Tankers are not "high tech" weapons. So, maybe, if iScotland could produce them cheaper than Korea, they could get the orders from rUK. But, given they haven't already, it seems unlikely.
26	37780948	37780133	NYorkie	3	04 July 2014 6:16pm	I don't dispute your statement, rUK tax payer will just have to pick up the bill if or as and when they do. However According to the unions, Babcock had noted the Scottish government's plan to remodel Rosyth and Faslane after independence, but said it remained unclear whether workloads would be smaller or greater than now.
27	37781301	37779598	ID320158	1	04 July 2014 6:34pm	Erm, there is a programme underway to replace the aging Type 23 frigates with the imaginatively named Type 24.
28	37781412	37780346	Bangorstu	3	04 July 2014 6:39pm	If, as someone else has said, no British yard bid for the contract, then none of them can really complain if the Koreans did. You have an excellent point however if a British yard did want the job.
29	37783795	37780037	Liesandstats	13	04 July 2014 8:05pm	The Type 26 would not be built in Rosyth. Once the Carriers are welded together at Rosyth, thats it. Its only hope of any further work is not defence related, its defence work went to Devonport years ago. However it does have the largest dry dock in the UK and the only one big enough for the white elephants with no planes.

Excuse me? You've got a vote, why do you waste it on a UK government that doesn't provide jobs in the north of England, and punishes English students with outrageously high student fees? (Hint: the Scottish grant doesn't stretch to giving free education to the whole of the UK). Get yourselves some decent regional parties, the SNP can't be expected to look after areas outside Scotland, although quite a few seem to find it an appealing idea.
37	37790994	37780346	1649	2	05 July 2014 12:51am	I understood they were actually merchant vessels owned by the MOD and crewed by civilians. Not 'warships'. As for the contract going to Korea, an outrage. Though it is a bit rich for many BTL to whinge about this. If it was left to them, they would not be built at all with the money instead frittered away on supporting the cultural elite.

The carrier and it's likeliest escort (Type 45 destroyer) both have SAMPSON radar, the best in the world. Type 45 also has Sea Viper missiles and Phalanx CIWS. Carriers aren't obsolete yet.

65	37780194	37779915	paul mullins	3	04 July 2014 5:44pm	Thankfully not everyone has Vulkan! I would still argue Sea Viper/SAMPSON combination could take out Vulkan. Experiments are currently be done with SAMPSON to see if it can be a 'off the shelf' strategic missile shield.

It would far too easy to shoot out of the sky long before it got close.  But I see your point - it seems silly building any fighting machine when the enemy will just design something to take it out.

69	37782405	37782080	paul mullins	1	04 July 2014 7:21pm	A couple of years ago, a F 15 Strike Eagle successfully shot down a satellite. Could a carrier fast jet take out a ICBM? I don't think it's beyond the realms of fantasy. The SAMSON radar (that the carrier has) is capable of picking up ICBM's. In regards to the expensive toys point, I would say fail to prepare, prepare to fail. We only got the Falklands back because of carriers. We were also able to launch air strikes against Serbian forces during the civil war in Yugoslavia.

It may be that a swarm of $1000 drones, each with a few hundred grams of explosive becomes the unbeatable missile shield. Or that small cheap drones (in numbers) replace fast fixed wing aircraft altogether. Who knows? Even the Vulkan (which is 1980s kit) is a weapon that has a range of hundreds of miles. The days of being within sight of your enemy are long gone. A slow-moving, 65,000 ton target is surely not what you want... I bet the carriers are mothballed or sold off due to obsolescence within a decade.

73	37785689	37778568	Lysicamus	0	04 July 2014 9:05pm	I doubt that a ballistic missile would render them sitting ducks because they have to be aimed at a fixed point and aircraft carriers are not fixed, they are moving. By the time a ballistic missile arrived the carrier would be elsewhere. Now a submarine is a different matter..............
74	37787398	37778568	Spokeydokey	0	04 July 2014 10:39pm	The RN has only 6 GMD's and 13 Frigates. Now consider refitting and Maintenance periods and leave periods...you should be able to work out how much sea time the new Carriers will get when they eventually get aircraft. They can't go to sea alone as they need a supporting battle group due to the fact that they are a big easy target! However we have plenty ex Admirals who probably believe these ships are a good idea!!!
75	37802997	37783682	paul mullins	0	05 July 2014 12:29pm	Good point. Against less high tech adversaries, carriers still have merit.
76	37839118	37782405	arbitrarynight	0	06 July 2014 5:53pm	Just what are you on. Most large radars can pick-up ICBMs. I doubt this toy has the necessary fire-control equipment to control missiles or whatever else to destroy ICBMs. > fail to prepare, prepare to fail. But prepare for what? You still haven't said what mythical enemy we're supposed to be preparing for. The RN has 78 commissioned ships, mostly built for the Cold War. As shown innumerable times, preparing for the last enemy will screw you over every time. Without a fairly big support fleet, you're pretty much screwed in the force projection department. You know, tankers, troop-ships, assault vehicles. The Merchant Navy has no ships to cover the RN's short-comings, and even the RFA has ships rented from the Danes, amusingly enough. Maybe we could rent some destroyers from the Yanks like we do SLBMs? Ah, Britannia. Wherefore art thou? In the meantime we could ask our enemies to wait whilst we arm these ships with some aircraft. Oh, wait. Is the F35 - the most expensive aircraft in history - grounded before it even hits service? Oh dearie me. Quite the little fuck up we have going on here.

80	37778646	37777521	shinsei	28	04 July 2014 4:44pm	By "killing machine" you mean stuff like the Royal Navy outlawing slavery and piracy on the high seas throughout the C19th ?
81	37779313	37778646	UncleBacterial	21	04 July 2014 5:07pm	I mean the constant pillage of autonomous cultures from the conquest of American Indians to the shit storm we have created in Iraq today. Death toll so high it pales that of both world wars when you account for the amount of empirical slaughter taken beneath that flag.
82	37779663	37778646	UncleBacterial	16	04 July 2014 5:20pm	Know your history. The navy was an arm of slavery. William Wilberforce et al campaigned for decades in parliament for the abolishment of slavery.
83	37779825	37779313	mygreatgiddyaunt	11	04 July 2014 5:26pm	You'll presumably agree that only a pusilanimous pus-bucket would live in a country that he had such contempt for. By the by, which country are you living in these days?
84	37790593	37779825	personguy	4	05 July 2014 12:35am	Having contempt for foreign policy is not the same as having contempt for a country.
85	37791114	37777521	1649	1	05 July 2014 12:57am	Like the abolition of slavery? Or seti? Or defeat of fascism? Or the maintenance of open see lanes? Or the development of medicines? Or or Radar? Or of the jet engine? Or the steam Turbine?
86	37804169	37779825	UncleBacterial	2	05 July 2014 1:17pm	I am Welsh, I live in Wales. I worry greatly about the version of History taught to us. We do not teach ourselves enough of the ills, violence and grievous nature of Empire, we have plowed on with expansionist economic policy which itself morphed out of empire. When the British empire clashed with the other empires in the first and second world wars, it too was involved with persecution of peoples - from the concentration camps in South Africa to the terror inflicted on India, the infliction of a Caste system, the dividing of cultures in pursuit of its own interest. The rich have used us, British citizens, to commit all manners of crimes against humanity over the centuries, and indeed up until this present day. It troubles me that we are not able to turn the eye of scrutiny in on this embedded brutal nature, but proceed with a tired superiority complex. It will not bode well for us in a global world that is changing rapidly, either to continue our pursuit of aggressive foreign policy or to ignore the ills of the past, we must as a culture evolve peacefully or face destruction - that is my view.

88	37780002	37777675	asmar	20	04 July 2014 5:34pm	Perhaps it should carry elephants. That worked for Hannibal....
89	37780339	37777675	real tic	15	04 July 2014 5:50pm	ugly carrier, as ugly as it namesake, as ugly as the planes that will fly off it. but then I suppose expecting a warship to look good is asking too much. At very least they could have avoided naming it after the head of state, doing so generally brings bad luck to navy ships.
90	37781192	37780339	worksforcommunityorg	3	04 July 2014 6:27pm	"expecting a warship to look good is asking too much"  HMS Hood is an example of a warship which looked very good.
91	37781504	37781192	real tic	3	04 July 2014 6:44pm	until it sank.  anyway, in those years UK had plenty of battlecruisers and other capital ships. Today, discounting the fleet subs, it has none until the new QEs are commissioned.
92	37785797	37780339	Lysicamus	2	04 July 2014 9:11pm	I think the ship and its namesake are handsome, the aircraft less so. Bismarck, Tirpitz and Hood were all handsome ships.

96	37779878	37777682	Herbgold	22	04 July 2014 5:28pm	When last I looked, Appledore (Babcocks), Hebburn (A&P Tyne), Portsmouth (BAE) and Birkenhead (Cammell Laird) were in England. Scottish components supplied by Rosyth, obviously, and Glasgow (BAE Systems again).
97	37777728		pter1960	107	04 July 2014 4:18pm	this piece of crap is precisely why Scotland should vote yes and specialise in cheap anti ship missiles
98	37779518	37777728	RonJB	14	04 July 2014 5:15pm	Or just some more small and speedy ships: <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/navy-shadows-russian-warship-off-moray-coast-1-3242089" rel="nofollow">http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/navy-shadows-russian-warship-off-moray-coast-1-3242089</a> I googles this, and there do seem to be a lot of Russian close encounters with Scotland. Now, call be paranoid, but is it some sort of deal between the government and Putin to scare the Scots into staying in the union (unlikely as it would call for some diplomacy skills for Westminster), or is Russia planning to invade and make an independent Scotland part of the Russian Federation? Maybe instead of two massive aircraft carriers, they should have built fifty or a hundred destroyers with drones?
99	37780070	37777728	worksforcommunityorg	21	04 July 2014 5:38pm	"Scotland should vote yes and specialise in cheap anti ship missiles"  Yawn. People who don't know what they are talking about have been saying that aircraft carriers are useless, since the late 1950s [1]. There is no need for them we are told.  Claptrap, as history from the 1950s has demonstrated.   [1] the 1957 Defence White Paper asserted that manned aircraft were obsolete and should be replaced by guided missiles...
100	37780941	37780070	frfintonstack	7	04 July 2014 6:15pm	Yes, because technology hasn't moved along at all since then.
101	37782372	37779518	FredDibnah	1	04 July 2014 7:20pm	Your paranoid
102	37783066	37782372	RonJB	8	04 July 2014 7:40pm	Well, I would have preferred "you're".
103	37795220	37780070	ClaudeNAORobot	0	05 July 2014 6:47am	I've missed something... were it published today, that 1957 document would require to explain that we cannot replace by guided missiles the manned aircraft that aren't there. Talking of aircraft that might be put on this ...er... aircraft-carrier, if aircraft of one type are not available today, are there not aircraft of another type? I mean, for example, what happened to the aircraft that were on the previous aircraft-carrier(s)? There were Harriers that could land in a car-park and on a carrier. Where are they? Why can't they use this ship? Lost those? OK: Can't helicopters of designs old or new use aircraft-carriers?
104	37823935	37795220	RonJB	0	06 July 2014 7:02am	The Harriers were sold to the US military on the cheap (and quiet), for use as training aircraft.
