1	39186489		Pope123	151	08 August 2014 11:21am	Britain's only priority should be making sure that this disease does not make it to the UK. Once again the need to far stronger border controls is demonstrated.

Once again the need to far stronger border controls is demonstrated. </blockquote>  I find it quote sickening the way that any opportunity to inject anti-immigration rhetoric into a thread, whatever the topic.  Britain's best strategy for protecting itself from ebola is to give health care support to the afflicted countries. It may surprise you that viruses don't share your prejudice and will take the opportunity to infect any traveler, whatever their status. In addition, we might just consider helping out of humanitarian concern for others regardless of any self interest.

Nowhere does he mention immigrants.If there are people with Ebola in other countries, why should we not have better screening at the border so as to ensure we do what we can to keep it out if at all possible? "Regardless of any self interest"?? - Hey everyone there's a deadly disease making the rounds, lets be sure we don't do anything stupid or selfish like look out for ourselves. Top notch commentary - really.
5	39191148	39186489	Anothersmallcog	12	08 August 2014 12:44pm	In the spirit of the sentiments you propose... Scotland is a small remote country - if only we had independence we could control our borders and keep out English infected during their business trips and gap year visits to West Africa. Not sure I'm for that old chap.
6	39191607	39190014	Thegentletock	51	08 August 2014 12:52pm	Ever heard of an incubation period? "Border control" is a clearly a knee-jerk not based on an informed view of how to control a virus. Given the poster also says the UK's ONLY priority should be avoiding importation, it's pretty safe to say their agenda is more anti-foreigner than anti-virus (a) because control of the virus abroad is in our interests too and (b) because it's perfectly possible to focus on preventing spread to the UK and care about the impact elsewhere - they're not mutually exclusive.
7	39193653	39186489	conanthebikeman	25	08 August 2014 1:31pm	What an odd thing to say. As far as I know Ebola does not recognise border controls - however strong they are.
8	39194310	39186489	madmonty	45	08 August 2014 1:41pm	The best way to contain a disease is at the hotspot of is breakout. Movement within infected areas should be restricted, plus flights out of such areas should be stopped.  The only way to bring in more restrictive controls at UK borders, would literally mean quarantine centres. The Marburg virus takes around 2 to 4 weeks to fully express itself and that would mean keeping people in what would be classed as level 4 microbiological quarantine. This is very expensive to do as any microbiologist will tell you. It's better we send expert help and cash to Africa to fire fight the disease there.

It's not worth the expense. 2. Ebola isn't very easy to catch. 3. Putting up ever more barriers to keep out those dirty foreigners is turning us into a nation of racists.

11	39196504	39194665	elmerofoz	22	08 August 2014 2:20pm	When AIDS was made a homophobic issue instead of a public health issue (as it should have been), it has continued to spread and millions have died. This is not a race issue, it is a public health issue.Lucky for other countries that people in these countries are having their temperature taken before boarding planes as they should, because in the countries effected it is what it is...a public health issue.
12	39196642	39195787	TenderBranson	15	08 August 2014 2:22pm	<blockquote>  Why all the palava if it is not very easy to catch? </blockquote>  Because then you'd be complaining not enough precautions were in place.
13	39197163	39196642	dierobdie	20	08 August 2014 2:32pm	There are a lot of people who are quite scared now. You are obviously not one of them. There is a desperate shortage of aid workers now, why not volunteer to go and lend a hand?  I'm sure they will give you some rubber gloves and a paper mask which is, as I'm sure you will agree, plenty of protection against what is a fairly mild and difficult to catch virus. Then you can come home to the hero's reception that will be awaitng you!
14	39197331	39195787	FuzzySpider	34	08 August 2014 2:35pm	<blockquote>  Why all the palava if it is not very easy to catch? </blockquote>  There were three incidences of a "rollover" by 737 Boeing jumbo jets caused by the design of a certain valve that operated the rudder. When it was freezing cold, and when burning hot oil flowed through it, there was a tiny tiny chance the valve could jam and put the rudder out. Three incidences, in 40 years of air travel by an aircraft design which has more flight hours than anything else. One of those aircraft takes off every minute. These weren't three incidences per aeroplane, these were three incidences ever, and the investigation went on for years because it was so hard to figure this out. Nothing had happened during testing, things had been tried and retried. And it was a mystery for the NTSB for a decade. When the cause of the three rollovers was found found what did they say? Did they say "well this happens only 0.0000001% of the time the aeroplanes are in the air and will likely never happen again for another 10 years, so forget about it"? No, they had the FAA change the valve on every single aeroplane in service as a precautionary measure. When you are talking about a disease like Ebola, which is very very nasty if caught, precautionary measures will be taken above and beyond what would work, simply because it is better to be safe than sorry.

Nowhere does he mention immigrants. </blockquote>  Pope123 said:  <blockquote>  Once again the need to far stronger border controls is demonstrated. </blockquote>  The use of the phrase 'once again' would suggest that the accusation that Pope was spouting anti-immigration rhetoric is completely justified.  And re border controls, it's not a perfect situation by any means, but open borders are far more controlled than closed borders. Closed borders will mean that people will travel illegally, under the radar, and we'll have no way of knowing where or when the virus has been spread.

Once again the need to far stronger border controls is demonstrated.  </blockquote>  At least three mistakes here:- Disregarding the need to do something in the places where Ebola is actually happening and existing resources aren't proving up to the task of containing transmission or treating patients while schools and other facilities have had to close and health services are also unable to provide much of the help they would usually.- Overstating the utility value of border controls.- Overstating the risk to the UK. If cases do come here, we do have the facilities to treat them. Also, the particular conspiracy theories and cultural attitudes to disease, funerals etc. which have hurt case containment in the affected countries don't have much traction here. Finally, from history we can see that <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/resources/outbreak-table.html" rel="nofollow">there has never been a sustained outbreak of Ebola in any rich country</a>.

Its quite possible he could have meant something else, but a quick perusal of previous posts suggests that it was an anit-immigration reference.  <blockquote>  "Regardless of any self interest"?? - Hey everyone there's a deadly disease making the rounds, lets be sure we don't do anything stupid or selfish like look out for ourselves. </blockquote>  Looking out for ourselves is not inconsistent with looking out for others.

22	39205329	39189627	mightymatt	8	08 August 2014 5:12pm	What is sickening and selfish is people like Mohamed Tholley who i believe has not yet been found and could possible be infected putting many at risk.Do you believe china were concerned about immigration when they shut down an area that just recently had case of the plague?There are many people in these effected areas who want to leave and seek sanction in uk, honestly i don't blame them as it is a terrible situation to be in but then the task of screening everyone in reality is to much of a cost and it is indeed safer and cheeper to if not close entirely or put massive restrictions at boarder control and all linked flights in and out of know infected areas. You have to keep in mind volunteers are more reluctant to go and help making the issue even greater problem without sufficient care plus common sense will tell you that in such fast moving and heavily populated areas such as london the virus would spread like wild fire. It has nothing to do with anti-immigration or people being selfish in anyway to take steps in protecting our country the best way we can.

26	39211000	39186489	justanotherflyboy	6	08 August 2014 7:34pm	my goodness, aren't you a charming fellow. border controls are a waste of time and money, and only encourage kneejerk idiocy like your comment above. screening travelers for febrile illnesses is all that's needed. and it benefits everyone in the world to provide aid to the countries affected by the outbreak, precisely to moderate the outbreak and prevent further international transmission. immigration has nowt to do wi't. maybe you should go away and learn to think.
27	39211719	39205329	justanotherflyboy	5	08 August 2014 7:56pm	this virus doesn't spread like wildfire, not even in Liberia. it is not flu, and is far harder to catch than flu. don't touch dead people, or the bodily secretions of the sick ones, and you're all clear. I suspect the only reason the doctors are catching it has more to do with complete exhaustion suppressing their immune function, as doctors tend to work till they drop in such a situation. and border controls never work the way the idiots think they do.

29	39216502	39194665	neolab	9	08 August 2014 10:25pm	Who says it's not easy to catch ? Read the hot zone, in it a CDC scientist say you could get ebola/marburg by just having 4 or 5 virus particles on your eye lid. Assuming that's correct and given how many medics have contracted it despite being covered head to toe I'd say it's quite easy to catch. For example, someone who has it touches something like a door handle, handrail, is a bit sweaty and then you touch the same surface and then you touch/rub your eye, bingo..

31	39218288	39190014	Gastinel	3	08 August 2014 11:33pm	Border controls only help to pick up people who are symptomatic. It is possible to pass on the infection during the incubation stage. Therefore if an index patient travels to Paris and rides on a bus, before you know it you have infected weekend holiday makers returning home to the Common Travel Area. (CTA - I think I've just found a new name for the British Isles if Scotland gains independence - Ireland's already in the CTA). The best chance of fighting this is at source.

34	39221916	39216502	justanotherflyboy	3	09 August 2014 4:04am	oh, FFS! The Hot Zone is a popular semifictional story, told to make money and entertain bored people for a while. it doesn't much resemble reality. the doctors who got infected probably ran themselves right into the ground working who knows how many hours a day and days in a row -- because that's what doctors *do* in these situations. the precautions are being taken just in case -- but if it was that damned easy to catch we'd be re-enacting "The Stand" already -- and we're not, we're not even close to that. calm the fuck down, man.

50	39218575	39211117	Gastinel	3	08 August 2014 11:45pm	I believe the original commentator was being sarcastic. Diseases are often spreadable even when the patient is not showing symptoms e.g. the virus can shed from saliva or even sweat deposited on shared items. Lift buttons were believed to have been one of the agents in SARS. So you really can't stop it once it starts to spread. Best chance is to locate and isolate early outbreaks at source.
51	39186973		Tim Eslip	93	08 August 2014 11:30am	The big problem for us now, after the all dire warnings about avian flu, pig flu SARS, etc., which, while helping to transfer gargantuan sums of public money to BigPharma, didn't actually come to much, is the credibility of present and future warnings.  It's a classic case of the boy who cried wolf caused by an insane economic system that puts shareholder profit above all other concerns including life or death.

56	39197827	39186973	synclsp	10	08 August 2014 2:45pm	What terribly faulty logic. "Oh, the last time we all got in a tizzy and the WHO caused a big palaver, nothing happened and someone made money out of it. Therefore, any time the WHO is worried, we should FIRST think about who's going to profit from vaccines." Did it occur to you that the reason that there wasn't a massive outbreak was because of the work of the WHO and governments acting on it? And if there was, then that'd be money well spent to save thousands of lives?
57	39201146	39186973	Deebles	9	08 August 2014 3:48pm	You're comparing apples and oranges here. The SARS situation was a serious problem of a new disease spreading rapidly that got stamped on. So far as I'm aware, no pharmaceutical companies made much money out of it. Bird / swine flu they did make money from, because of tamiflu etc. Ebola? Prevention rests on quarantining cases and maintaining careful barriers while treating them. Meanwhile, the main treatment is fluid resuscitation. Hard to see how they'd make much money there.
58	39211233	39186973	justanotherflyboy	2	08 August 2014 7:41pm	no flu virus ever discovered has anything even close to a 50% mortality rate. agree our economic system is insane, and definitely don't think Tamiflu helps at all -- but this is a whole different kind of illness. hopefully it can be controlled at source, and not spread further. in service of which goal, international medical aid and personnel are *mission essential*.

69	39187146		John Sinclair	95	08 August 2014 11:32am	As Ebola has up to a three week gestation period and London is teeming with people from the West Africa coming and going on sweaty London tubes we have an ideal infection route via escalator handrails, train hand-holds, ticket machines etc etc etc. So there isn't a hope in hell of keeping it out of London if it really gets going in Nigeria for example.
70	39187503	39187146	TenderBranson	128	08 August 2014 11:38am	You're probably already infected from merely reading this article. Head for the hills, now!!! It's your only chance. Save yourself.
71	39187934	39187146	KenFine	14	08 August 2014 11:46am	People fit enough to travel aren't infectious.
72	39188688	39187503	scuba100	27	08 August 2014 12:00pm	obviously you are an expert in relation to the transmission of this infection.Your services are probably needed in the areas affected. I assume you are on your way.
73	39190307	39187146	thisnamewilldo4now	11	08 August 2014 12:30pm	Where, or what, is "the West Africa (sic)"?
74	39191535	39187934	bamyasinick	55	08 August 2014 12:51pm	'People fit enough to travel aren't infectious.' You mean apart from that guy who flew by plane to Lagos with ebola? It seems so far that only the doctor and a nurse, who treated him, contracted the virus, but we can't be certain yet. The fact is that you can definitely travel while experiencing the initial symptoms.
75	39192140	39187934	Galandriel	33	08 August 2014 1:03pm	Patrick Sawyer hopped on a plane knowing he was infected. A lady vomiting inside a cab started the Liberian outbreak.
76	39192619	39187146	factoryreset	6	08 August 2014 1:14pm	<blockquote>  we have an ideal infection route via escalator handrails, train hand-holds, ticket machines </blockquote>  Don't forget blood diamonds. It could be gestating in the ring on your partners finger!
77	39198438	39187934	bekibunny	31	08 August 2014 2:57pm	Youre back to this? Well, obviously you're wrong because of what's happening in Lagos. Someone was (just) fit enough to travel, and they infected 9 people that we know of. Someone was fit enough to travel to Morocco and die there.Someone was fit enough to travel to Saudi Arabia and die there. Get the point? They've admitted that they have no idea how many people could be infected in Morocco, and they don't even seem to really care. How long is a flight from Morocco to London?
78	39198873	39198438	TenderBranson	5	08 August 2014 3:05pm	<blockquote>  How long is a flight from Morocco to London? </blockquote>  London is already infected, according to previous comments here, probably due to people from "the West Africa" living there.
79	39199930	39198438	KenFine	9	08 August 2014 3:25pm	The suspected Moroccan case is reported to have been a heart attack victim, and there is still no confirmation of the suspected Saudi case. You can travel while infected, but not showing symptoms. What's so hard to understand about that?
80	39202072	39199930	bekibunny	17	08 August 2014 4:05pm	The Liberian guy who died in Nigeria was showing symptoms while on the plane. He collapsed as he was getting off the plane. Now 9 people who had contact with him are infected. What's so hard to understand about that?
81	39203288	39202072	TenderBranson	3	08 August 2014 4:30pm	<blockquote>  Now 9 people who had contact with him are infected. </blockquote>  Nope, 6 of which are suspected, no confirmation of actual infection.
82	39203574	39202072	KenFine	3	08 August 2014 4:36pm	You neglected to say that all of those he infected were hospital workers attending to him. There is still no evidence of Ebola virus transmission by casual contact, such as sitting next to an infected person on a plane, but you seem quite desperate to convince us that this does happen, and that it poses the risk of a global pandemic.
83	39206107	39203574	bekibunny	5	08 August 2014 5:28pm	wrong, at least one person was someone who helped him off the plane
84	39206391	39206107	KenFine	3	08 August 2014 5:35pm	Really? I think you just made that up.
85	39208670	39187503	middleagedman	2	08 August 2014 6:30pm	To be fair he does have a point.
86	39209093	39208670	TenderBranson	1	08 August 2014 6:41pm	There has never been a case of Ebola in the Western hemisphere. So his point is moot.
87	39212868	39187934	screaminkid	7	08 August 2014 8:28pm	you just keep believing that rubbish? The Drs treating this disease aren't wearing those suits as a Fashion statement?
88	39218879	39188688	Gastinel	3	09 August 2014 12:01am	I find people who sarcastically volunteer others for duty simply because they don't agree with them to be extremely tiresome. The original commentator has a point. London and even more so - Paris, have huge ties to Africa and are therefore quite exposed. An infected but non symptomatic patient could potentially spread the virus through shared items which are touched. This is how SARS was spread. Plastic lift buttons proved to be good reservoirs too.  For the above reason it is in the UK's interest to help stop the spread at source.
89	39228040	39212868	KenFine	0	09 August 2014 10:13am	The doctors are treating people who have become seriously ill, and are infectious. What has that got to do with symptomless travellers?
90	39231552	39218879	scuba100	1	09 August 2014 12:00pm	I find people who purport to be experts in the transmission of this disease tiresome.

92	39187170		Eikon	51	08 August 2014 11:32am	It's only a matter of time before Ebola gets on a plane and visits the world at large.
93	39187680		rascal87	29	08 August 2014 11:42am	It's only a matter of time until we all die....... EVERYBODY PANIC.
94	39197053	39187680	elmerofoz	19	08 August 2014 2:30pm	I would just prefer it to not be shark or ebola.
95	39199940	39197053	Carolyn Davis	14	08 August 2014 3:26pm	UH, Dr Sawyer got on a plane and dropped dead shortly thereafter . Sawyer, stopped over in Ghana and Togo on his way from Liberia to Nigeria the day he fell ill. He was planning to return to his family in Minnesota in mid-August. His movement across West Africa sparked a search for 30,000 people he may have come into contact with. Dr Brantly treated him.
96	39211887	39187680	justanotherflyboy	5	08 August 2014 8:01pm	tinfoil hats, gitcher tinfoil hats here! peanuts, popcorn, Hazmat suits, tinfoil haaaaats!!!
97	39218954	39199940	Gastinel	1	09 August 2014 12:04am	A doctor was the index patient for SARS in Hong Kong too.
98	39187688		DavidoM	60	08 August 2014 11:42am	Should have been doing this two months ago when MSF were saying it was out of control.
99	39187898	39187688	fatquarter	28	08 August 2014 11:45am	Yes and before that it was a back page story. But we just left it. Had we sent aid to Africa then, it would have been contained by now.

101	39192221	39190230	factoryreset	11	08 August 2014 1:05pm	<blockquote>  Some army general would have had a nice new Humvee though. </blockquote>  Yeah, like the failure of the world health programs that eliminated Smallpox. Why bother...
102	39198622	39187688	bekibunny	7	08 August 2014 3:00pm	This is the unfortunate truth. but only Africans were dying then, and the world thought it would stay there, so it didn't care.Its only now that 2 Americans have been infected and its starting to look like it can travel to the rest of the world that our governments have decided to do something.I'm reminded of the old adage about stable doors and bolting horses...
103	39198719	39192221	blairsnemesis	2	08 August 2014 3:02pm	He's on this page by accident - look at his comment history. He only speaks football.
104	39206435	39198622	DavidoM	10	08 August 2014 5:35pm	I was putting comments in a month ago saying no one in the western media was paying attention .....that it was serious So unnecessary that it got to this, it will cost multiples of what it might have cost if effort had been made to contain and treat it earlier.  MSF are saying the drug resistant TB is a problem now... western complacency is the same over that. It is on the street now..
105	39212027	39206435	justanotherflyboy	2	08 August 2014 8:05pm	yep, they call that TB the White Death. it arose in the Russian prison system. and it will definitely be a problem. even so, like all TB, it still isn't that easy to catch. unless you are sharing a 10 x 12 prison cell with a dozen infected men who cough all day, your risk of catching it, while larger than zero, is infinitesimal.
106	39216067	39212027	DavidoM	0	08 August 2014 10:09pm	Drug resistant variants are endemic in Africa and parts of Asia.. bits people go to for cheap surgery, gap years, beach holidays etc. Yes it is hard to get but it is getting close to impossible to treat...... but I would admit CRE bacteria are growing as a threat across the West.
