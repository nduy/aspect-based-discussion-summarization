2	25790192	25789702	JulianG	346	06 August 2013 4:53pm	Alas, they are probably on zero hour contracts. And treated like shit.

7	25791012	25790192	AShortFuse	1	06 August 2013 5:18pm	to be fair, all the shit in the sewer is treated.... so they probably are treated much like the shit is

11	25792252	25789702	londonnites123	7	06 August 2013 6:03pm	I agree. Those sewage workers work day and night to ensure giant fatburgers do not destroy our way of life. Also David Cameron should consider ex lax when he is that blocked up and has to go to the restroom. Jus' sayin...

14	25793799	25789702	FreakyChucker1	53	06 August 2013 7:10pm	Couldn't agree more. I live in Kingston! They should get whatever the ghostbusters got - a open-top bus parade through Kingston at the very least. I like to think that's basically what these guys are, the ghostbusters, but with giant, bus-sized globules of disgusting, stinking, steaming (!) rancid, shit-filled grease instead of, you know, ghosts. In fact, I reckon I'd rather face actual ghosts than what's been described here. It must have smelled like satan's cock down there. Just as well we're not having one of the most prolonged spells of really hot weather in years, because that would really delicately place the decorative glace cherry atop the whole shit-sundae. Oh, wait... Seriously, thanks guys. Great job!
15	25794456	25793799	ponk2k	10	06 August 2013 7:39pm	<blockquote>  It must have smelled like satan's cock down there. </blockquote> More like Satan's arsehole I reckon
16	25795606	25793799	alanomaly	10	06 August 2013 8:39pm	<blockquote>  They should get whatever the ghostbusters got </blockquote>  Being immortalised in a film seems fair. I reckon one of those Simon Pegg / Nick Frost films where an ordinary guy learns his real priorities in life through battling an underground fat monster, while also battling the uncomprehending indifference of his self-absorbed friends and partner.
17	25796405	25792448	JulianG	2	06 August 2013 9:22pm	I was being facetious. I agree with you, of course. :)
18	25797916	25790242	Mischieftess	3	06 August 2013 10:41pm	Well, statins don't work to break down and remove cholesterol and plaques. Instead, they inhibit an enzyme (HMG-CoA-reductase) that produces cholesterol in your cells, thus reducing further damage from high cholesterol levels. To fix atherosclerosis, there are surgeries and other medications, but you really don't want to flush loose chunks of plaque into your arteries - they will get trapped in narrowing arteries (like coronaries of the heart) and cause infarcts. A more apt analogy may be that these people are "like human laxatives."

53	25790589	25790330	Tonester7	67	06 August 2013 5:04pm	Is it not quite an important adendum though? The prospect of every bus in London running on used fat is pretty impressive, roll that out to the whole country and bingo bango bongo, thats a large reduction in our carbon footprint jah.

55	25791824	25790690	theoldManxman	3	06 August 2013 5:46pm	Not really. The oils that get reused as bio-diesel are going to be different from the heavier (usually) animal fats that cause this sort of blockage.
56	25792222	25791824	SpiritedAway	4	06 August 2013 6:02pm	It's fatty related.

71	25790947	25790446	muscleguy	15	06 August 2013 5:15pm	This was Kensington, I expect the proportion of people who actually cook for themselves is fairly low. So it's restaurants and takeaway places and the hired help who know no better in the residences.
72	25791240	25790446	Alexandria	13	06 August 2013 5:25pm	It is a bit unclear to me what the wet wipes are that causes some of the problems. Are these the things for wiping your hands when you can't use a basin, which you should throw in a bin, or are they moist toilet tissues, which we are always told by the manufacturer are flushable? Also moist toilet seat wipes, which are also sold as flushable?
73	25791357	25791240	T0nyN	8	06 August 2013 5:29pm	Just because they are "flushable" does not mean that they will decompose quickly, just that they will fit down the drains.
74	25791438	25790947	ocdc	35	06 August 2013 5:32pm	No, it was Kingston. To quote muscleguy:  <blockquote>  Read the whole article before commenting. It will stop you looking foolish and the practice will improve your concentration span.  </blockquote>
75	25791570	25791240	siff	4	06 August 2013 5:37pm	Wet wipes are made of some artificial material, and don't disintegrate or rot like toilet paper does.
76	25791614	25790947	elcid96	9	06 August 2013 5:39pm	Er, no, this was Kingston. Try reading the first line :-)
77	25791643	25790947	noirnoirnoir	23	06 August 2013 5:40pm	I was walking down Kensington high street late one night when the binmen were collecting rubbish off the street and one of the restaurants had seemingly thrown away binliners full of congealed fat. Once the binmen chucked them into the lorry, the bags punctured showering one of the binmen and the road in this foul goo that stank of vomit and fish. The the binmen and I then began to vomit. True story.
78	25795040	25791240	JohnnieGoat	11	06 August 2013 8:08pm	toilet tissue, moistened or not, is made of tissue paper. it rips easily and degrades. if it hits a blockage, like the edge of a slipped pipe or a tree root, it can build up but wet wipes - baby wipes, cleansing wipes, etc - are made out of sterner stuff. they don't degrade or break easily, so build up more easily they also catch other stuff flushed, acting as a base for detergent, scale, etc people who flush this stuff really don't know the impact it can cause further down the line and sanitary towels - they should be bagged and binned, not flushed. they are a nightmare
79	25805497	25790947	Monty84	1	07 August 2013 8:59am	It was Kingston. Not many people have hired help there.... Lot's of takeaways though

83	25790548		conanthebikeman	19	06 August 2013 5:03pm	Sounds like an episode from Doctor Who. Or the next sculpture on the 4th plinth in Trafalgar Square

Instead of the aliens sticking captured people to the wall with resin they'd be glued into a fatberg gasping "Kill me! I can't stand the smell anymore!"
85	25790571		JohnnieGoat	93	06 August 2013 5:03pm	similar happens under Leicster Sq each winter - men go in with wheelbarrows and shovels to clear piles of congealed grease there are estates in NW London where grease is a huge problem - lots of oil used in cooking and poured down the sink we had a problem in a pipe under the back garden - tree roots broke through a pipe looking for water. the roots cause a natural framework for people flushing wetwipes, nappies, sanitary towels, etc - people really are morons. add to that build ups of detergent powder, oil and lots of delicious human waste as it was a comunal pipe, and no one else had a problem, no one else was bothered. until the pipe completely bloked and the natural incline of the street made all their gardens fill up with raw sewage initially jets and pump truck tried to clear it, but eventually it was proven the tree, roots and blockage was outside the property boundary. so thames got to dig it up and reline it the sewage and drains systems we have a amazing works of engineering - its only when they break we realise how lucky we are to have such convenience to clear away our mess

101	25832508	25790622	bobble4293	0	07 August 2013 10:32pm	At one time it was! I listened to the MD of an animal feed company some years ago, referring to the fat removed from the sewers around Leicester Square being used to make animal feed. He said "of course, you can't use it for chicken food, they die so easily, but you can use it for cattle food, it takes a lot to kill a cow!" So, yes, indirectly, that fat ended up in your beefburgers. That was before the practice was outlawed as a result of CJD.  The food industry is managed by some of the most cynical people!
102	25869853	25832508	JohnDory	0	08 August 2013 11:43pm	And once they've used up all the sewer fat for the cattle feed, there's always enough the sewer rats left over to make a lovely supermarket beef burger. Mmmmmmm
