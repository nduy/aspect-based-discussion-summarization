1	38596442		MysteryTor	19	25 July 2014 10:57am	Of course climate changes. The climate has been warming for about the last 12,000 years, since the peak of the last ice. When this interglacial period ends, the climate may well cool again and take us into another ice age. Get over it.
2	38597906	38596442	Wobbly	40	25 July 2014 11:27am	'Get over it'? No, maybe best if you get informed.  March on record, at 0.71C (1.28F) above the 20th century average of 12.3C (54.1F).The combined average temperature over global land and ocean surfaces for April 2014 tied with 2010 as the highest on record for the month, at 0.77C (1.39F) above the 20th century average of 13.7C (56.7F).The combined average temperature over global land and ocean surfaces for May 2014 was record highest for this month, at 0.74C (1.33F) above the 20th century average of 14.8C (58.6F).The combined average temperature over global land and ocean surfaces for June 2014 was the highest on record for the month, at 0.72C (1.30F) above the 20th century average of 15.5C (59.9F).

4	38598832	38598372	Wobbly	39	25 July 2014 11:45am	The IPCC has published at least 5 reports. One has around 27 pages of references. There were over 9,000 peer reviewed scientific papers published in 2012-13, all confirming man-made climate change. It's all on line and free, fully referenced, etc, so over to you.
5	38599161	38596442	Strollinby	23	25 July 2014 11:51am	Hello, Mr Bolt. I thought your standard line was things have been getting colder since 1998? Nothing like denying that the sky is up, trains run on tracks and Mr Rabbit is a dimwit.
6	38601030	38598832	MysteryTor	6	25 July 2014 12:26pm	Okay, try a big-picture view. The Pleistocene era has been characterised by a whole series of ice ages separated by interglacial warm periods, such as the one we live in now. There is no reason to think this cycle will not continue and the IPCC certainly can not tell us.
7	38601321	38599161	MysteryTor	0	25 July 2014 12:31pm	Ur, no. My name's not Mr Bolt and my standard line is that things have been getting warmer for the last 12,000 years. Whether the 'sky is up' is surely a matter of perspective. Trains do mostly run on tracks. And if 'Mr Rabbit' is Tony Abbot, you're spot on.

If you see ice caps on Greenland and Antarctica, it's an ice age, period. So, that means outside of an ice age it's usually much warmer . Why's that do you think? Fire pixies?

21	38628781	38596442	Alpo88	11	26 July 2014 12:23am	Wrong Denialist argument, as usual. We all know that the planet goes through cycles, we don't need your little self to tell us. But what your crappy brain still doesn't understand, is that the current warming trend that started in about 1600 has accelerated since the second half of the 20th century. It is such acceleration (that is not smooth, as it is affected by the roughly 11 year solar cycles) that tells you that the planet is warming beyond its natural cycle. That excess warming is what the greenhouse effect of industrial CO2 emissions explains. Now, get over it once and for all, copy this and paste it somewhere, so you can remember... as you do that, you may sit out in your porch, waiting for the Little Ice Age to come if that's what you wish.... good luck!
22	38630842	38628781	DougofArmidale	7	26 July 2014 2:58am	Yep ...............another 18 years without accelerated warming should prove it for all time. And the ocean surface temps...a waste of time and printers ink.
23	38631200	38630842	Alpo88	11	26 July 2014 3:35am	Doug, I have tried to teach you (across websites) about climate change for some time now, and you still don't learn. So, once again. Denialists start their "hiatus" in 1998 (an El Nino year with record high annual value of temperature anomaly). Following 1998 we were on the descending curve of a solar cycle, that lasts about 11 years. This is recurrent, and during the accelerated phase of global warming there have been previous periods of periodical slow downs in warming associated with solar cycle minima. Now, the 1998 temperature anomaly record was broken in 2010, that is 12 years later, thus signalling the end of the low phase of the solar cycle and the initiation of the higher radiation phase. Therefore the accelerated phase is back on track. Your "18 years without accelerated warming" is just a lie, please just stop repeating lies. Moreover, during the "hiatus" the trend has always been towards warming, although at a decreased rate for the reason I explained above. There has been NO overall cooling during that period. Denialists just like to scavenge for small periods of temporary cooling to prove their point, that only demonstrate that they are scavengers of ad hoc, cherry picked evidence. Real scientists know and use the full information available: the inter-decadal records of temperature anomaly show relentless warming. While you keep on waiting and crossing your fingers for the Little Ice Age to come ask the farmers of Australia how is that climate going for them.... See you in January 2015 for the temperature anomaly of 2014: The hiatus is over!
24	38631940	38596442	PaulRobert1	3	26 July 2014 5:18am	Whether you believe that Climate changes naturally or is man made is not the point of the article.

29	38658493	38658008	Alpo88	5	27 July 2014 1:17am	Brilliant link, SirGeo, I urge everyone to go there and read.... and think!Regarding the last figures on Arctic and Antarctic sea ice where the values of sea ice anomaly has been decreasing in the North (as expected from global warming) but slightly increasing in the South (which may seem somewhat counter-intuitive), readers should consider that Arctic sea ice is already made up of salty water, whereas in Antarctica the sea ice around the continent is also affected by the melting of the freshwater ice on land. As freshwater ice melts (because of global warming), it decreases salinity around the coast thus increasing the freezing point temperature, therefore favouring the appearance of sea ice even under global warming conditions. There are other likely factors as well to explain the difference, but that's a pretty obvious one.

Do you also expect say, your weather forecast for the second Friday in September to be provided to the nearest degree? Do you expect to know predicted economic growth for the month of May 2016 to the nearest percentage point? It is become such a perversion of reasonableness when scientists, using the best available information, are mocked for seeking to make informed and prudent predictions about issues of major consequence such as climate-induced environmental damage and threats to public health.  Why don't you linger on e.g. the Bolt blog, where there are plenty of wilfully ignorant, unread climate change deniers who are very happy to be told on a daily basis that man-made climate change is fiction.

There is no proof from the tens of thousands of research papers worldwide to justify the conclusions that are being preached. What we have are just theories!  And the theoretical predictions of the year 2000 have come and gone without any evidence of climate change. The same goes for every year science the Soviet like science came forth. What we have is simply this:  The authorities are telling us all that we must obey - even if there is no proof to justify this " science. " And unless we obey, we are called names, punished and our names are registered as non-believes. Soviet " science " is just the same.

We've had now, what is it, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/21/world-breaks-temperature-record-june-hottest-may" rel="nofollow">around three hundred and fifty months in a row of above-average global temperatures</a>? What would you call that, if not climate change? Ice melt? We're currently losing well over a trillion tonnes of ice each decade from the Antarctic and Greenland ice shelves, the two main continental ice reserves on the planet; the summer Arctic sea ice may well be gone within a few short years; amost every glacier on the planet is in full retreat. Here in Australia, the exacerbation of drought conditions over the past thirty or forty years has been linked by careful research and detailed meteorological observations to a change in Southern Ocean currents and wind systems connected to -- spoiler alert -- climate change. Moisture-bearing air just isn't being delivered to the southern half of the continent in the way that it used to be, and all the indications are that this situation is going to deteriorate further as the currents which could help us move further offshore in response to the warming atmosphere. This almost certainly means yet worse droughts, yet worse fire seasons -- oh, I forgot, Tiny Habit has reminded us there's no connection between climate change and bushfire. Silly me. Proof? You're thinking of mathematics, perhaps. Science doesn't deal in proof. It deals in evidence, and there's that in abundance. I'd suggest you open your eyes. And lay off the scare quotes.

I don't have all the resources of university departments, but look, I read wikipedia and I can show you that they have got it wrong. Is it obtuseness? I went to school and I know the climate changes by natural means from century to century. I learned that in high school. Is it religiosity? God made the planet and He wouldn't do that to us. Is it bloody mindedness? Don't tell me I am killing the planet. I'm OK, you're not. Is it greed? I am making money, money, money. Get outa my face. Is it modesty? I am just a little person, one of billions. I couldn't make that much difference. Is it contrariness from feeling inadequate? I don't care what you say. You can't prove it, so there. Is it indifference? Doesn't affect me. Nothing to do with me. Leave me alone. Is it childishness? The weather will be better if its a little warmer. 1 or 2 degrees means Winter will be more like Autumn. Lovely. Is it insensitivity, frog in the kettle? I can't see any difference. What's the fuss about. Is it fear? Probably not. They think all the bad stuff will happen to other people in other continents. Nothing to see here. None of it is very interesting or useful. Me, I drought proof my garden, and proof my home against excesses of heat and cold, to say nothing of rising energy prices as millions try to keep cooler or hotter. Sounds like Perth should begin digging Roman style cisterns instead of storing water above ground where it evaporates at a great rate. The ones around the Mediterranean are fantastic and supported an empire for centuries.

56	38626952		mrfunbro	12	25 July 2014 11:01pm	Well it seems science deniers always seek the last word. Maybe they seek it in all philosophical and intellectual spheres, and are just "know it alls". The last word in this debate will be the actions of nature. Unless 97% of the planets climate scientists are wrong, the current government inaction could be catastrophic. A couple of increased risks I can think of are: we could get crocodiles swimming off the Sunshine Coast, dengue fever in Brisbane and nudists in Melbourne. It just makes so much more sense to move to renewable sources of energy whether you want to deny science or not, only a fool will argue against this point.

To reject the years of research and data peer reviewed by experts and embrace the ideology of those with a fossil fuel agenda is incredibly stupid unless you are one of those vested interests. To avoid also being tagged as hypocrites, one would expect that they also went to witch doctors when they are sick, never travel by sea (to avoid falling off the earth) jump out the window instead of using lifts in tall buildings and turn off the computer. If you reject science, don't take advantage of it.

I was sceptical about a big new tax on carbon (diamonds, the stuff in pencils etc) but these guys really made it seem the easy way to have a bet each way. Get some revenue AND lower the carbon footprint, (just incase)... Wait...what...you say...? ARGGH now I am really confused.

Cuts by the Abbott Noalition to the CSIRO and other specialist bodies are attacks on the very specialisations needed not only to effectively participate in these new technologies but also to minimise latent and usage risks in such a sophisticated environment. In mid-May '14, the ABC's Rafael Epstein forced an uncomfortable Sen. Scott Ryan to admit that since there was more money in the 2014 budget for school chaplains than for Australia's principal scientific research organisations, it was fair comment that for his government school chaplaincy was of a higher priority than the nation's scientific research effort.

Also many areas being devastated by the drying out of large areas including Australia, parts of the United States, Northern Africa etc which will lead to wars over access to fresh water.On top of this many "Tropical Diseases" (Malaria, Dengue Fever) will spread further south in Australia which means we need to prepare for these events in advance.Climate Change will have major changes to the Social Fabric not just to Australia but the entire World and the sooner we learn to address these problems the better.Because whether you believe in Climate Change or not these events will occur and will impact on us all

Not since July 28 1911 had Brisbane felt that cold, getting down to a brisk 2.6C at 6.41am. . It was brisk enough to refresh my health that morning, I can tell you. .

75	38634487		ianhassall	7	26 July 2014 8:36am	Did they consider ranking all the potential threats to public health and then consider where climate change sat ? I'd say obesity, inactivity, and smoking would all rank higher than an esoteric issue like climate change. Year-on-year there hasn't been a downturn in argicultural production for the past 300 years despite increasing global temperatures and CO2 atmospheric concentration. Look at the graph from 1961 to present, we are swimming in food. Its almost like CO2 is plant food, rather than poison. Just a thought. <a href="http://crash-watcher.blogspot.com.au/2011/10/global-food-production-and-consumption.html" rel="nofollow">http://crash-watcher.blogspot.com.au/2011/10/global-food-production-and-consumption.html</a>

86	38635262		R_Ambrose_Raven	5	26 July 2014 9:15am	It is very wrong to assume that humans would be able to adapt to any possible warming. Heat stress imposes a fundamental upper limit. Any extended period over 35C will induce hyperthermia in humans and other mammals, as dissipation of metabolic heat becomes impossible. While this never happens in the natural environment now, it would begin to occur with global-mean warming of about 7C, while with 11-12C warming such regions would encompass the majority of the human population as currently distributed. While central estimates of business-as-usual warming by 2100 are 3-4C, eventual warming of 10C is quite feasible and even 20C is theoretically possible. Artificial climate means it will happen much sooner. Manila, like most modern cities, is already several degrees warmer than surrounding areas in the day and is stifling at night because of the urban heat-island effect, which releases the heat stored in concrete, roads and buildings at night. "A 4C rise in temperature will make life unbearable and air-conditioning an absolute necessity. Air conditioning, for instance, is no remedy - power demand would soar, it would be unaffordable for billions in the third world and for protection of most livestock, it would not help the biosphere or protect outside workers, it would regularly imprison people in their homes, and power failures would become life-threatening.  Complicating the daytime heat extreme are nights that are insufficient cooler. Heatwaves in regions unaccustomed to them will kill lots of people. Vulnerable people, such as children and the elderly, are especially susceptible to heatwaves. in such circumstances, their health problems amplify very quickly.
87	38642496	38635262	DenisPC9	4	26 July 2014 1:33pm	"Any extended period over 35C will induce hyperthermia in humans and other mammals, as dissipation of metabolic heat becomes impossible. While this never happens in the natural environment now, " It has, check the European heatwave of 2003, it is estimated that around 70,000 mainly elderly, died. Interestingly enough they had a repeat in 2006, they were more prepared this time round. If that elevated temperature becomes the norm, then that is a concern. And that was expressed in France at the time.

90	38636559		Ronnie2014	5	26 July 2014 10:00am	Thankyou Guardian for yet another excellent article. It is most comforting to know that despite Tony Robots attack on organisations concerned with climate change and the environment that scientists still continue to produce such great work .This think tank of eminent scientists are trying to help Tony Dumb Dumb out with policy initiatives that will assist the population to deal with the many repercussions of climate change.I am also amazed by the predominance of climate science deniers in any discussion of climate change. LNP trolls perhaps. How on earth can anyone deny the science. All I can say is yes the world is flat. We can also escape the effects of the increase in temperatures and the number of cataclysmic events by living underground. But don't worry the Minister for Destroying the Environment will simply cut their funding

94	38659516		alloomis	0	27 July 2014 2:36am	sounds like fun, this meeting. but politics is the struggle for power, not the management of the nation by selfless technocrats. if you really want to do something about climate change, first get democracy. then, with citizen initiative, action becomes possible. not before.
95	38659686		Treefern	3	27 July 2014 2:55am	How is it that people who insure their houses don't see any value in "insuring" the planet by moving to a low carbon economy? We have everything to gain and nothing to lose.

Does this government realise we're in the 21st century?
97	38660999		ops2048	4	27 July 2014 5:37am	I find it outrageous that the Australian Academy of Science is forced to fund this ad hoc research and advocacy. This research and policy generation should be ongoing and should be the remit of an uncensored and properly funded CSIRO. This report proves that this government is failing in it's most basic duties of care. This government has lied it's way into power, has no mandate for it's actions, represents narrow corpratz power and does not in any sense govern for "all of us". This government is totally illegitimate. Resistance is not futile. Considering that citizens are using their tax cuts to crowdfund the Climate Commission demonstrates just how parasitic and redundant our current Lords and Masters with their eye-watering wages and hypocritically nauseous neoliberal ideology really are.
