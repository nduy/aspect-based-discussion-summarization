3	37763891	37763306	boulay	63	04 July 2014 10:19am	yes because obviously labour will just spunk billions at the armed forces. maybe they could use the bankers bonus tax for the 28th time to buy 5 more american sized aircraft carriers.  or perhaps if labour had done the commissioning job more sensibly then the costs might be different or only one would have been built. but of course it is the fault of the evil tories.....

5	37764179	37763546	blatantfraud	26	04 July 2014 10:26am	No, so Britain can defend itself and its interests. I have no truck with Blair and his participation in Iraq, btw.
6	37764281	37763891	blatantfraud	27	04 July 2014 10:29am	What a refined answer. It's not Labour butchering the armed forces it's the tories. If Labour had set in train the present cuts the right wing papers would have been bellowing non-stop. I never trust tories on defence and security - they are penny pinchers. Their attempts to cut costs by making the best trained army in the world little more than a border defence force, and filling it out with reservists is, as predicted, a complete farce.
7	37764388	37763306	TVGuide	15	04 July 2014 10:32am	Bit harsh to blame the Tories for these aircraft carriers being inadequate. Labour ordered 2 carriers but didn't plan for the associated support craft(frigates destroyers etc), hence why one will be mothballed. They also ordered the wrong planes.
8	37764535	37764388	blatantfraud	11	04 July 2014 10:35am	I'm not blaming them for the carriers, I'm just saying their defence cuts are a disgrace. It's not lack of support ships that is likely to cause mothballing - it's tory defence cuts. Wasn't it them who cut the number of T45 destroyers, designed to escort the carriers, from 8 to 6 ?
9	37764707	37763306	Eisenhorn	10	04 July 2014 10:39am	<blockquote>  No doubt the tories will mothball one </blockquote>  Yup! Only one of them will actually sail around the place. The other one is going to be tied to a dock in "extended readiness"... Although, to be fair, it's hard to lay this one at the door of the Coalition government; the procurement balls-up and cost over-runs of this project are almost perfectly fairly shared out to drench absolutely everyone in basically-equal amounts of shame.
10	37764741	37764535	boulay	4	04 July 2014 10:40am	i am angry about cuts to the armed forces - very angry - but to be honest where is the money to avoid cuts. can you imagine the outcry if defence spending was ring-fenced or increased when there are cuts everywhere else. as usual the bean-counters in whitehall and government are "fighting the last war" and we see countlessly that we are unprepared when something happens and have to play catch-up however i just dont see where the money is for more ships (something i believe passionately in), soldiers and planes. it is frankly a no-win situation for any government at the moment.

They can't afford enough aircraft to fill even one, let alone two bigger ones.
12	37764854	37764707	blatantfraud	1	04 July 2014 10:43am	Twas just an illustration of the tories obsession with slashing Britain's forces.

14	37764997	37764804	blatantfraud	16	04 July 2014 10:46am	According to the tories nothing can be afforded - except cutting taxes for the well off (while increasing them for the worst off).

They even made the wrong decisions on aircraft leaving an unholy, expensive mess for the Coalition to clean up. Any contracts for mates would have been the responsibility of Labour so I don't see why you are attempting to smear the Tories when the party of lies and corruption were voted out in 2010. Remember Ecclestone, Hinduja, Mandelson and all the Labour MPs sent to gaol before smearing a party that has restored the economy and faith in public services.

I suspect you are joking when you claim nothing can be afforded.
17	37765532	37764962	blatantfraud	3	04 July 2014 10:59am	Ok - thanks for the correction. Labour carries the can on that one, then.
18	37765608	37765387	gilesjuk	3	04 July 2014 11:01am	The deficit is still big and the national debt enormous.
19	37766031	37764535	TVGuide	9	04 July 2014 11:12am	No it was in 2008 that the number of type 45's was cut to 6.I don't agree with the defence cuts either, I'd much prefer the overseas aid budget cut but the Labour regime deserves to take the blame far more than the Tories.

21	37766444	37765203	smifee	3	04 July 2014 11:23am	Ah, well you seem to know a lot about it. Would you please explain exactly what happened in 2010? How exactly did the Coalition effect the contracts, the cost and the over-all project with their flip-flopping on the ships and the planes? On a more general note, how was it okay for the Coalition to renege on UK Government contracts signed and sealed. Reneging on contracts is poor business practise (because it is so expensive to alter contracts and because no-one willingly enters into a transaction if they can't be sure the deal will be honoured.) The Coalition's Party driven petulance since 2010 over existing government commitments has under-mined the UK government's reputation as a business partner. Well?

This is an unnecessary behemoth ordered at the height of the Iraq lunacy that the coalition should have cancelled. The only point of large aircraft carriers is to project military power overseas. This we do not need to do.
23	37767806	37764741	kvlx387	13	04 July 2014 11:58am	<blockquote>  i am angry about cuts to the armed forces - very angry </blockquote>  As long as Britain doesn't get involved in the kind of foreign 'adventures' that Blair loved so much, the armed forces are actually too large. Britain has the fourth largest military budget in the world, but doesn't face any substantial military threats not of its own making. Your anger is your own issue.
24	37767884	37764388	Oldgroaner	1	04 July 2014 12:00pm	Labour ordered these white elephants (see details on Chinese anti-carrier ballistic missiles) as part of a job-creating vote catching project. It would have been cheaper to have given the builders a few 100KÂ£ each -- though the electoral bribe would have been a little too transparent.

The reason they were assembled on the Clyde is obvious. Firstly, Goven and Rosythe have specialised naval yards placingthem at an advantage for this role. Secondly, I can't think of any other UK shipyards - let alone naval yards - that remain with dry-dock facilities large enough to accomodate a fully completed hull of this size anywhere in the UK - can you?  Where do you think it should be assembled? The Tyne, The Mersey or perhaps The Wear? Well these are non-starter's due to the closure of all their dry-docks over 1980-85 and the failure to dredge riverside walves and river-beds. The two largest dry-dock's on the Tyne, would be a possibility but they are now 'water-features' that are part of riverside housing complexes. Maybe this physical and logistical impossibility is purely down to 'Brown garnering votes'? The nearest dry-dock of that size outside Glasgow is probably Zee-Land, or St Nazaire where the similar sized Charles de Gaulle was assembled.
27	37768855	37767884	blatantfraud	2	04 July 2014 12:23pm	as part of a job-creating vote catching project. Well, it's a change from saying Gordon Brown had them ordered as they would be built in his constituency - shown as a lie by the simple fact that they have been constructed around the UK in sections. Still wrong though - western navies are ordering carriers (smaller) and landing ships to deal with the 'asymmetrical' threats posed by terrorist groups and have been doing so for years.
28	37769008	37765203	blatantfraud	9	04 July 2014 12:27pm	before smearing a party that has restored the economy and faith in public services. laughable - they plunged the economy into extended contraction and far from restoring faith in public services have cut them drastically for ideological reasons. No doubt you blame the world financial crash on 'socialist overspending' as well. Cameron and the tories still thought they were too regulated - imagine how bad it would have been if they'd got their way.
29	37769087	37767564	Swedinburgh	4	04 July 2014 12:29pm	This may well be the first time I have agreed with you, but hey-ho... you're exactly right about aircraft carriers. They have nothing to do with "defence".
30	37769171	37768748	blatantfraud	3	04 July 2014 12:31pm	These two carriers were commissioned and built in Scotland purely to garner votes for Brown and Labour. This is, as the tories know, an out and out lie. Reminds me of the charge that Labour are the party of the 'layabouts', yet when the incompetency of ATOS is raised they shout 'Labour introduced them'. Can't be the party of the lazy and bring in ATOS, after all.

There was the opportunity to install catapults and traps, making the carriers compatible with French and US naval aircraft and giving the option of buying the cheap, effective and in-service F/A18 Super Hornet (from Boeing). The US Navy even offered to help. Instead, BaE insisted that it couldn't be done without spending billions and so now these carriers will only be able to fly the absolute clusterfuck that is the F-35B - if they ever get it to work - and which, co-incidentally, is part manufactured by... BaE. It's an absolute disgrace and it happened on Cameron's watch after BaE effectively blackmailed the government.
34	37771068	37768748	Williamballoch	1	04 July 2014 1:19pm	Technically, they're not being assembled on the Clyde. Rosyth Dockyard is on the Firth of Forth, on the east coast. Some of the modules were built on the Clyde by BAE at Scotstoun Shipyard, and the much mentioned, but soon to be shuttered Govan Shipyard.

39	37774331	37771016	Abimelech	2	04 July 2014 2:41pm	Not really. Unlike previous carriers (or the US and French nuclear carriers/carrier) the Queen Elizabeth and Prince of Wales are powered by gas turbine/electric drives and hence lack the serious steam generation capacity which is needed for conventional aircraft catapults. The opportunity may arise in future to convert them to use electromagnetic catapults (planned for the next generation of US carriers) but that is an as yet unproven technology. The carriers should have been nuclear powered with steam catapults but that was ruled out at the start (I agree about the F-35B).

Obviously if you consider it likely that the next 50 years won't require any Protection of vital shipping/trade routes.Support of Allies overseas.Maintaining treaty obligations.Comitment of forces as part of a multinational force.Defence of vital interests/sovreign territory.Urgent interventions against agressor states.Humanitarian Interventions Etc etc...then we wouldn't need any armed forces...but its not very likely in an increasingly chaotic and unstable world is it ;)
41	37774636	37763306	shortcake	1	04 July 2014 2:49pm	Wonderful Nu Labour cut the forces more than the ConDems have done (e.g. Navy cut by 35%) and committed them to two prolonged conflicts which they were not equipped or resourced to fight. Everything they did in defence, including the carrier project, was a complete shambles and none of their clueless lightweight defence secretaries could manage to stay in the job for more than 6 months. What a bunch of clowns.
42	37775113	37764535	shortcake	3	04 July 2014 3:02pm	Nu Labour defence cuts were a bigger disgrace: 1 aircraft carrier cut (Invincible decommissioned 8 years early).6 destroyers cut (T45 order reduced from 12 to 6).6 frigates cut (including 3 almost new T23 frigates).SSN force reduced from 12 to 7.Sea Harriers axed 10 years early, some of them only 9 years old.Helicopter numbers cut.Deep cuts to minor war vessels and support ships, operating budget and training also cut. They axed 35% of the Navy between 1997 and 2013 but were the experts at covering up their destructive handywork with gloss and spin.
43	37775607	37772731	Swedinburgh	0	04 July 2014 3:16pm	Saudi Arabia's big spending in the last two years is a short-term spike - they've just completed huge deals for new American fighter-bombers, German tanks and other armoured vehicles, and will start taking delivery next year of new warships ordered in a Â£10-bn naval expansion programme in 2011.In another year or two, the UK will most likely be back in the top 5.

68	37767984	37767757	Oldgroaner	1	04 July 2014 12:02pm	Yes. As well as the bribe, the support group for the carrier will swallow up almost half the Navy's major combat vessels -- and provide no defence against ballistic anti-carrier missiles.

I went for levity on this one, as it happens, as I suspect anyone unfortunate enough to read the post would be quite capable of discerning its irrelevance and need a spot of cheering up.
73	37771311	37765973	jackthekipper	1	04 July 2014 1:25pm	Agreed, but you could just as easily fly drones off a Mistral or a Juan Carlos at a tenth of the price with the added amphibious assault capability.
74	37771441	37767305	fevriul	2	04 July 2014 1:28pm	<blockquote>  The Harrier is a lovely aircraft but very complex and enormously expensive to run </blockquote>  Are you having laugh? The GR7 was updated, the Engine has been in use since the 1960 and is well understood, expensive my backside, do you work for BAE?
75	37771554	37767984	fevriul	1	04 July 2014 1:31pm	Seen any of these Ballistic Anti carrier missiles tested? Will they be as good as the dolphins with the lasers on their heads? To hit a carrier in thousands of miles of ocean you need to be able to find it, its hard enough with normal ASM , your saying that the chinese or whoever , missiles that can launch from thousands of miles away spot a carrier and hit it? Step away from the keyboard.

77	37771769	37765881	Frugal_Dougal	3	04 July 2014 1:37pm	Why not 6? Or 8? They only cost Â£6 billion each!!!!!! And they'll be really useful for stopping terrorists downing airliners, or combatting climate change, or replacing failing antibiotics. I name this ship "The Red Herring"
78	37772051	37771311	matthewpringle	1	04 July 2014 1:46pm	We should have just kept the old planes, which would have been much better. Especially as they had just been upgraded. Some of these drones, the ones the US navy are looking at, as going to be nearly as big as carrier planes. I would think having the massive deck will come in useful many times over, if the carrier ever gets the equipment to operate effectively and safely. http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/multimedia/archive/00430/132169733__430907b.jpg
79	37773039	37764615	bellebrise	2	04 July 2014 2:11pm	Seems like going up a blind alley. If the F-35s don't perform then we have built expensive helicoper platforms. Had we installed catapults then we would have had a choice of planes from US, Sweden and India.Some things never change - no, hang on - they must have since we led the world in carrier technology...

81	37773522	37771769	maico	1	04 July 2014 2:21pm	Actually, it's around Â£3.2 billion per ship or the equivalent to six months of the UK aid budget.
82	37773785	37763708	Cynical007	0	04 July 2014 2:27pm	Due to the slight problem of their engines catching fire.
83	37773886	37771171	Ellis000	1	04 July 2014 2:29pm	Better a typo than a stereotype. Labour spend billions of taxpayers' money on a vanity project to secure a few votes in Scotland and the Coalition have to sort out the mess. Labour stereotypes here slag off the government for doing the right thing because, guess what, Labour good, Tory bad. All a bit immature don't you think?
84	37774318	37765032	shortcake	2	04 July 2014 2:41pm	1) Nu Labour killed British fixed-wing naval aviation when they scrapped the far more useful Sea Harriers in 2004-6. The GR9s we were left with were useless to the Navy as they could not provide fleet air defence - the main reason for having them in the first place. A GR9 carrier air wing would be a waste of time - all it would be able to do is provide close air support in a low-threat environment. It would be comprehensively slaughtered by even moderately capable opposition. 2) By 2007/8 we had no fixed-wing carrier capability to speak of anyway as the 10 GR9s maintained at readiness were deployed in Afghanistan, as were the Sea King AEW helicopters, and carrier training and deployment had more or less been abandoned. The rest of the GR9s were mothballed or being raided for spares to keep the aircraft in Afghanistan going. We could not have put together a viable carrier air wing even if we had wanted to. 3) The only reason the USMC bought the UK Harriers is to cannibalise them for spares to keep their more capable AV-8B Harrier 2s flying until the F35B arrives. They have no option as parts for such an old aircraft are now in short supply and there is no other jet that can fly from their assault ships.

86	37775279	37771441	Polymorph	0	04 July 2014 3:07pm	I'm not saying it was obsolete but it is notoriously complex and fuel hungry especially in vertical VTOL mode. Although it only has one pilot it costs twice as much to train him compared to a Tornado pilot and flying costs are greater to the tune of approx Â£2000 per flying hour. Of course, there are two personnel in a Tornado so that helps to balance costs in that respect. I'm not making a judgement here. These are just some of the facts. Both aircraft have their strengths and weaknesses. However, it seems like both are better, and certainly more proven, than the F-35 in its current slightly shaky form. I don't work for BAE. Do you work for the Navy?
87	37775363	37771165	Polymorph	0	04 July 2014 3:09pm	Indeed. Isn't politics wonderful?
88	37775606	37774885	shortcake	1	04 July 2014 3:16pm	Correct, but most people do not realise this. They confuse the GR9 with the Sea Harrier, for the Navy the only worthwhile variant as they could provide fleet air defence. Nu Labour did the real damage when they prematurely scrapped the Sea Harriers. However, it was done with such sleight of hand that unless you take an interest in the military you probably would not know anything about it.
89	37763421		eoinomahony	75	04 July 2014 10:07am	"...a naval tradition dating back thousands of years which combines a celebration and a solemn blessing." Really? Thousands?
90	37763572	37763421	mutie	19	04 July 2014 10:11am	Yes, I wondered about that, too. Wikipedia mentions the ancient Greeks, Romans, Egyptians and - before them - Babylonians as all having some sort of ritual for a new ship.
91	37763706	37763421	Alphagamma	61	04 July 2014 10:14am	The first known named ship was the Praise of the Two Lands which appears in a 4th Dynasty Egyptian inscription from more than 4,500 years ago. While breaking a bottle over the bow is more recent, ship naming ceremonies have existed since ancient times.

You're saying money invested in the military could have been invested in the military instead?
102	37773831	37763439	Cynical007	1	04 July 2014 2:28pm	Except they can't afford any planes to put on the thing. Just as well since the American ones they were going to buy currently have an unfortunate habit of catching fire when you try to fly them.
