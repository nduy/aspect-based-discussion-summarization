UNCONSTRAINED SUMMARY

The first comment said that Britain's only priority should be to ensure the disease does not come here, which caused an argument. Some said the commenter was bad for not feeling more sympathy for these people, and others said it was clear he was talking about immigration and bringing far-right policies into the topic, and that disease screening was what was needed. Some disagreed with this, saying border controls had nothing to do with immigration.
Others replied that the best way to control the disease is to provide aid to the country it began in and stop it at source. One said that ebola is quite hard to catch as it is through contact with fluid, and another replied asking why there had been such a fuss then, to which the answer was because ebola is nasty if caught and people would make a fuss if enough precautions weren't taken.
One person said that big pharmaceutical companies make lots of money from scares like this, as with bird flu which was never a massive problem, and others agreed but said it was the government's fault for purchasing the bird flu vaccines. One person said that it was probably because of the authorities' actions it wasn't as big of a crisis, another saying people would complain if the government did or did not aim to predict and prepare for things like this.
Some people commented saying they were unhappy with the xenophobia in the comments, another said the comments section online was like the daily mail lite and these people probably didn't read the actual guardian.
One person said that as ebola has a three week gestation period London was ikely to be a breeding ground through places like train station. Another said people with ebola weren't fit to travel, to which is was noted that a man got on a plane to lagos and spread ebola on his arrival, another person said a lady being sick in a taxi started the Liberian outbreak. People argued about whether various outbreaks were ebola or just a heart attack, how many people had been in contact with the man on the plane to Lagos and how many had got infected through him. It was mentioned that doctors who get ebola are probably very tired and their immune systems are weak.
One person said they should have declared outbreak back when it was starting to be a problem 8 months previous, another said it was only now americans were getting infected that the news media took interest. One person said if they had started working on it 2 months ago it would have been less expensive than it is now to treat and control, mentioned that drug-resistant TB is a problem there is complacency over in Britain. Another said that this was hard to catch, but someone added that TB is an endemic in Africa and parts of asia.
