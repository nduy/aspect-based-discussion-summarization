UNCONSTRAINED SUMMARY

Te comments discuss differnt apects od shale gas fracking. Most people are against fracking as they are concerned about its negative impact on the environment notably on drinking water contamination by fracking fluids and gas leackeges. A substantial minority, however, supports fracking arguing that there is no risk of water contamination or that fracking can be regulated such as to avoid such water contamination or any other damage to the environment. In addition fracking reduces Co2 and hels avoid global warning. Fracking opponents counter these statements claiming that shale gas as fossil fuel is not environmentally friendly. Also fracking chemicals and the ways they could leak through to the surface are discussed, and both pro and contra arguments are given for such possibility. Many posters give evidence both pro and contra fracking, explain how fracking works and discuss the credibility of the evidence. Posters generally agree that fracking is profitable for the economy as demonstrated by US. However, it is also noted that people involved in exploiting economc benefits from fracking are worried about their effect on health and environment and examples of a US businessman who filed a lawsuit against fracking is given. All posters agree that environment topics are not high on political agendas, but that pro-fracking attitude could cost parties votes. There are many jokes and ironic comments around fracking.
