UNCONSTRAINED SUMMARY

One person was happy about the heatwave, but another was negative saying they weren't looking forward to it. Another mentioned that they were sceptical it would even happen.

Some people joked that Britain's definition of a heatwave paled in comparison to other countries, and some people included anecdotes about their own countries, although some replied sarcastically to one of these that Britain is a completely different place and people are used to different weather. Others joked they lived in an oven and a freezer, or on Mercury, making fun of the person saying the British were amateurs. One person mentioned the hosepipe ban would be starting soon, one person joked about moving into a cave which another suggested would be the same as a cottage in North Yorkshire.

Some people debated about the use of air cons and fans. Those against the use of air con said it gives you dry eyes, it's noisy, costs a lot and is bad for the environment. Some people said a fan would be a good idea but one person replied saying it is only good pointed directly at the body to dry the sweat off. Some people said buying air con would be a waste of money as it is only hot here for a few days or weeks a year. One person said that they thought the UK would get hotter, and air con made it much easier to sleep. One person suggested a ceiling fan, but another said if you rent this wouldn't be possible and as Britain is only occasionally hot it would be a waste of money. Others said a standing fan, or a fan set on swing, is a good way to keep cool at night.

One person said they wished they didn't have to see weather reports for the South east on the website, but another added that this heatwave would affect the whole country, someone else sarcastically saying they had a chip on their shoulder. One person said London was a good place to be in a heatwave as there are lots of pubs and people get off work early, but another asked him if he liked all the smog. People then debated whether London was a nice place to live: two people said it was too busy, expensive and polluted, another aid they moved their from the countryside and they loved it. The original commenter who liked London said it was their choice if they liked it.

One person said how midges were a problem in this weather, another said they should shut the windows or get a screen. One person told an anecdote about the use of a citronella candle to put off midges where an American misheard midges for midgets, which was joked about, and another said they were surprised the candle worked as they had been severely bitten after using citronella oil.

Some people discussed how the media invented ridiculous headlines about temperatures soaring and plummeting, and invented silly headlines of their own.
