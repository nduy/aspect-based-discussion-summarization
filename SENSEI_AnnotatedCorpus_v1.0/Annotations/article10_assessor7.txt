UNCONSTRAINED SUMMARY

Several posters thank sewerage workers for cleaning the fatberg in Kingston upon Thames. Some of them say the workers should be rewarded. Others refer to their working conditions in the disgusting sewer and poor treatment of sewerage workers in general.

Several commenters compare the sewerage workers to declogging medication, statins or laxatives.

Many comments refer to a movie on fighting the fat, comparing the fat removal action to actions in several movies. 

A few commenters suggest that Tory politicians should be  put in the sewer. Others counter this by stating that Guardian readers generally always associate Torys with unpleasant things.

Several comments discuss the mayor of London and his lack of public appearance. 

Many comments discuss the disposal of fat and its renewability. 

Some joke with it being put into food, however, this is also claimed to be true as sewer fat was fed to animals at one point in time. Several commenters discuss how wipes cause sewer blockages.  A few comments report stories of similar problems elsewhere in London.
