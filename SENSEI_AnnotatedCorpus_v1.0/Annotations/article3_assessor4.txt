UNCONSTRAINED SUMMARY

The majority of the comments discussed the climate of Britain and what constitutes a heatwave here compared to other places or how people tolerate the heat. Some comments expressed disbelief at temperatures in the twenties meaning a heatwave for Britain and referred to temperatures elsewhere in the world, while others reminded them that a heatwave is relative and that Britain tends to have a mild, temperate climate. The discussion of heat tolerance mainly focused on air conditioning, with several commenters feeling fans would suffice and units are not necessary in the UK and too expensive to run, while others felt air conditioning was useful. A few comments detailed ways of tolerating the heat without relying on air conditioning. A small about commenters expressed negative opinions about the heat. A small group of comments discussed how the heat brings about the nuisance of midges and how to deal with them. A few comments reported on the weather where commenters were. Several comments discussed how newspapers report on weather in Britain, with all in agreement that headlines were predictable and many feeling that the articles were not necessary and redundant. A minority of comments mentioned how reporting on summer weather tends to focus on the south of England and not be relevant elsewhere. In a similar vein, several comments discussed the weather and summer in general in London, with opinion fairly divided on whether or not it was a positive experience. Outliers included a positive comment about the heatwave, positive comments on the sun, a prediction of an imminent hosepipe ban and hesitancy over Met Office forecasts. A couple of commenters discussed what the heatwave means for chestnuts harvests. The light-hearted nature of the article meant much of the discussion was not serious, leading to many humorous comments and jokes.
