UNCONSTRAINED SUMMARY

The commenters mainly discussed plain packaging. Some approved  and said it would be cool and that it would help while others believe it is a waste of government time and money and a useless initiative. A lot of commenters argued whether introducing it in Australia has reduced smoking and brought many examples. There were other various comments on the topic, such as that it might encourage smuggling and that the move was mainly about brand separation. Commenters also focused on the strength of the tobacco industry and its state in different continents in relation to bans and restrictions. Other explained how and why they buy tobacco and extensively discussed health risks and benefits. Commenters also talked about the connection between lung cancer and smoking. A commenter made an analogy between McDonalds and smoking but many opposed his view, saying they are not comparable. There were some aggressive personal comments against smokers, telling them to smoke and die. A discussion about the health risks of Diesel fumes occurred, with people defending and attacking it. There were also a few comments focusing on the meaning of life and how crazy it can get in relation to smoking, lung cancer and snobbery on the issue. Comments, vaguely related to plain packaging, mainly about politics, using sarcasm and suggestions, were also submitted. There was a good deal of jokes and personal insults as well.
