UNCONSTRAINED SUMMARY

The majority of comments raised concerns over new housing being too small and of a poor quality. Commenters said Tesco as a commercial business would minimise costs at every stage to maximise its profits. This worried the majority. But others suggested that big spacious houses with garages and lots of green space were not needed near London as people didn't own cars and couldn't afford them. 

The other leading concern was about the lack of affordable housing. Commenters said house prices have been consistently increasing and are too expensive for first-time buyers - especially in the south-east. Some concluded that the only option was to build smaller homes to keep prices down. 

A large number of people supported the scheme. They argued that it is better to build homes than to waste unused land. They also pointed out that the housing scheme is a sensible business choice for Tesco. The rise of budget supermarkets like Aldi and Lidl has meant Tesco cannot afford to build more supermarkets. So the commenters said they should sell the land off or develop it to generate profit. 

Others criticised Tesco for using the scheme as a publicity stunt. They disagreed that the scheme will help the community and tackle the housing crises and insisted their motives are commercial - to make money.

A significant number of people questioned how Tesco was allowed to get away with hoarding so much land. They criticised politicians and local governments for not toughening up laws to curtail the power of Tesco and other private companies. Some suggested immigration was used as a smokescreen to blame the housing crises on.

Others criticised Tesco for under-paying its workers. They said their low-paid employees should benefit from the scheme with a pay rise.

A number of people played on the 'every little helps' slogan to make a joke about small housing.
