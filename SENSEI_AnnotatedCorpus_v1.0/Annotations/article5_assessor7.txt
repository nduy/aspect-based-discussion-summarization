UNCONSTRAINED SUMMARY

Several readers discuss Scott Brown's career ambitions and claim that he only cares about his personal career progress not about public interest. This is also claimed to be true of Hillary Clinton and all politicians. A few commenters add that this is especially true of Republican politicians who only see to satisfy their lobby of white, male, Christian friends. 
Moving state to run for office is discussed. Most people agree that both Hillary Clinton and Scott Brown moved only once, so saying that they moved from state to state is unfair. 
One commenter claims that Republican political strategy is out of control, stating the suggestion to split California into six states as evidence. Another commenter refutes this claiming that splitting California is a businessman's idea that has nothing to do with Republican political agenda. 
One commenter suggests that the journalist should have provoked Scott Brown to physically assault him and put a recording of the fight on social media. This would have been courageous and win the journalist sympathy, fame and money, while ending Brown's campaign. Most posters agree that the journalist shouldn't have provoked violence, and that he acted professionally. Most posters think that it's Brown who showed cowardice, as evidenced by hiding in the toilet, refusing to answer questions and calling police on the journalist. 
Several commenters commend the journalist for his independet reporting practice. This leads to a discussion of journalistic standards in USA and UK, most commenters agreeing that UK laws ensure higher quality reporting than US ones. 
There is a brief discussion of USA health service triggered by the comment that the article also reflects how health system is run, i.e. without possibility to question. One commenter notes that USA should have modelled their health system on other successful ones in other countries, instead of inventing their own inefficient one. 
Several comments portray Brown as a weak politician without influence, who does not have clear political opinions and who has done a publicity stunt by having himself sent to Afghanistan on his National Guard Duty.  Several commenters claim that he is going to loose the elections in New Hampshire. A few commenters criticise the stance of Hobby Lobby company on providing insurance cover for contraceptives based on religious beliefs claiming that institutions cannot have religious beliefs.
