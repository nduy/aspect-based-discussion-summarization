UNCONSTRAINED SUMMARY

The discussion began with a few correcting what was reported as the billion pound cost for construction. They suggested that the construction cost would be less, and such figures represented sales, profit, cost of land and possibly social housing.   

Many then discussed the quality of the proposed houses and UK housing. Opinion was divided.  Some said that UK housing was becoming too small and there was concern that Tesco would build tiny houses with small gardens.  Others thought that apartment style living with small or shared gardens was a good idea.  This was linked to affordability. With house prices high, some commenters did not think many people could afford large homes, whereas apartments were affordable and would address land shortages.  There was some agreement that the Tesco housing should be affordable, but some questioned what affordable means. One was concerned about preserving greenbelt.

There were mixed views about Tesco's decision to build new homes.  Some approved it as a rational business move and good publicity.  One noted repeatedly that it was what the commenters had been asking for a few weeks ago in response to a news report on Tesco's land.  On the contrary, there was also much negative feeling towards what some saw as a move motivated by profit and greed.  Tesco was criticised for stockpiling land in the first place.  There was some concern about Tesco expansion and comment on Tesco as a monopoly and ?Empire?.  A few asked if the only local store would be a Tesco.

Consumer choice was mentioned by several commenters, people should not buy things if they don?t want to. 

Some commenters pointed out that that Tesco's staff were low paid. Others countered that wages were not exceptional for a business/supermarket.  Some doubted if Tesco staff could afford the new houses, some argued about whether Tesco should build homes for its staff.

Around 10% of comments were jokes on shopping and Tesco catch phrases eg ?every little house helps?.

One commenter raised the issue of immigration as a factor in the housing crisis, linking this to previous Labour policy.  This was strongly countered by others on various grounds: one said immigration is much higher under the current government; another argued that the real factors in the housing crisis were issues such as the stockpiling of land and that immigration was spun by Tory politicians to divert attention from their policies.    

There was discussion about whether people had an instinct to own their home.

A couple of commenters argued that we need policies to balance power of corporations.

CONSTRAINED SUMMARY

There was lengthy discussion about the size, quality and affordability of the houses and UK housing.  Some said UK housing was too small.  Some were concerned that Tesco would build tiny houses with small gardens.  Others viewed affordable apartment living with small/shared gardens as a good idea.  High house prices meant people couldn't afford large homes, apartments would address land shortages. Commenters called for affordable housing but some doubted if Tesco houses would be, due to concern for profits.
 
There were mixed views about Tesco's homes proposal.  Some approved it as a rational business move and good publicity.  One noted repeatedly that commenters had asked for this previously.  But there was cynicism by many who saw the move as motivated by profit. Some criticised Tesco for stockpiling land. Some showed concern about Tesco expansion and monopoly.  A few asked if the local store would be a Tesco.

Some noted Tesco's staff were low paid. Others countered that wages were unexceptional for a business/supermarket.  Some doubted if Tesco staff could afford the houses, some argued about whether Tesco should build homes for its staff.

10% of comments joked about shopping and Tesco catch phrases, "every little house helps".

One suggested immigration was a housing crisis factor.  Others countered on grounds, eg this was spin by Tory politicians to divert attention from policies.    

Some corrected the billion pound cost for construction. It would be less, and represented sales, profit, land and social housing.  

Consumer choice was mentioned by several commenters.
