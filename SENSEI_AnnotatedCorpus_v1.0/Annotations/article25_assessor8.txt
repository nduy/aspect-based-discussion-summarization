Label for comment 101 [murdamcloud]: reply98: agrees, about improving football skills with children using small games. Focus on touch skills not power. Not so pessimistic, think England are already heading this way. Not a recipe for success either as mighty Spain out too.
Label for comment 102 [PaulinNH]: reply99: disagrees that education a priority over football
Label for comment 103 [JohnnyDaPunk]: reply91:agrees children development is problem- thinks not enough chances to play the game, pitches made more available. Learn others lessons eg. from Canada and ice hockey experience.
Label for comment 104 [jararaca]: reply:99, disagrees, only USA gives higher priority to sport than education. Not the issue.
Label for comment 105 [dollishillbilly]: reply91: approves of the lengthy analsyis of structural problems
Label for comment 106 [lukasw]: reply99:again taking issue with education idea.
Label for comment 107 [goto100]: reply91: agrees with much. Thinks players have talent but lack early development because of education problem in tactics and skill. Thinks performances were not too bad. Possibly even unlucky. Echoes difficult draw. Thinks tactical problems too.

UNCONSTRAINED SUMMARY

A majority joined in mocking England - often with strong feeling - for an early exit from the World Cup. A sneer of "Rubbish" triggered scorn for England, several labelling the team "shit" and expressing laughter. Many delighted in a sarcastic chorus about the team hype and cursing with vitriol at how badly the team had performed. Many comments balanced this with humour, merciful for the brevity and cheery in defeat for their dashed hopes, while self-deprecatingly blaming it on TV replays! Some expressed sadness, but several admitted the previous disappointments meant they were past caring. One wondered if those still surprised had contributed to the failure.

Assessing the brief England campaign, some stressed how pathetic it was, warning they might end on zero points. One stated "worst since 1958" and the worst coach yet. This was balanced with mentions of "good possession" and promising play; World Champions Spain were also out. The performance was contrasted with minnows Costa Rica - praised for their success - also Spain (also out) and Scotland who were not playing, but had done better! 

The toughness of the group was discussed with disagreement that Costa Rica were really minnows and consensus around their achievement. Italy was an important result and they might go out too; three were former World Champions. Several went on to compare betting opinions. But several complained England had never done this badly before.

Many debated causes - manager, pampered players and systemic issues of the English game. Hodgson's speech was mocked unkindly, although some objected. Possibly replacing him was mentioned, but many thought blame lay with the workmanlike players who were not good enough. Managers are constrained by their players and others had faced the same issue. Disagreement was voiced about how attractive the football was. Many discussed and criticised a primadonna team culture as overpaid and overhyped by the media and fans. Rooney was singled out. Comments humorously wondered what the plural of primadonna was. Questions of passion and patriotism were much debated and media pressure criticised. Many more discussed long-term systemic problems of style and technical ability and the need to develop this in youth football education. The example of other countries needed to be borrowed from. e.g. FUTSAL. Continued FA failure was blamed, and media and clubs were also criticised for creating the moneyed modern England football game. Commenters were pessimistic change would occur.

CONSTRAINED SUMMARY

A majority vigorously mocked England for the early exit from the tournament. One "Rubbish" triggered scorn, several labelling England "shit" and expressing laughter. Many agreed about the hype and were vitriolic at how badly England performed. Commenters balanced this with humour, grateful for the brief campaign, self-deprecating in defeat, one blamed TV replays! Some expressed sadness, but several admitted they were long past caring.

Some stressed how pathetic the campaign was, warning England might end on zero. One stated "worst since 1958". Some reflected on "good possession" and promising play; that champions Spain were also out. This was contrasted with Costa Rican achievement.

The draw difficulty was debated: were successful Costa Rica really minnows? Italy might go out; three were former World Champions. Betting opinions were compared. Several complained England had never failed so badly.

Many argued about causes: manager, players and systemic issues of the English game. Hodgson's speech was mocked, although some objected. Sacking him was mentioned, but more preferred to blame pampered players who were incapable. Earlier managers had the same issue. Commenters disagreed how attractive the football was. Many criticised overpaid players overhyped by the media and fans. Rooney was singled out. Commenters disagreed what the plural of primadonna was. Passion was debated and media pressure criticised. Many discussed systemic problems with technique and education. Other countries could be learned from. e.g. FUTSAL. The FA was blamed; media and clubs were also criticised for creating moneyed modern English football. Commenters were pessimistic about change.
