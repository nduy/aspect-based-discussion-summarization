UNCONSTRAINED SUMMARY

The comments were overwhelmingly negative in response to the prospect of police officers getting increased powers, which would give them the right to look at medical records. 

The main concern was that this would prejudice the police against people with mental health conditions, such as if they saw that a potential victim was mentally ill they would be more likely to ignore their complaint. Without being able to see medical records, writers thought the police would be forced to take a fair approach to all cases. 

Many people saw increased access to their medical records as as a breach of their privacy. They were worried that the police would know personal information about themselves. Others said that they were happy for doctors to have their medical records because they were careful to protect their information, but they did not trust the police to have the same level of protection and respect for their personal records. 

There was a general lack of trust towards the police throughout the comments. SteveRP suggested that police already have too much power without access to medical records. Some people suggested alternative methods for the police to use, such as calling a person's GP to find out about their medical history without having direct access to it. Some people showed their disdain for the police without specifically commenting on the subject of the article. 

There was some fairly off-topic discussion about ways that medical history could be shown without needing to access records. SuburbanHomeboy said that people should carry ID to say if they had a serious medical condition.
