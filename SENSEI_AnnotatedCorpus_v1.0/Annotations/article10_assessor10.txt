UNCONSTRAINED SUMMARY

Seven commenters expressed praise for the sewage workers; some of those were concerned about their pay and conditions.

Two comments related to statins, following on from jokes about them.

Several comments seriously addressed the problem.  Some of these discussed using fat to make biodiesel (which some comments said wouldn't work on technical grounds).  Most were concerned about people flushing things that shouldn't go down the sewer anyway.

Six comments were complaints about other commenters, Guardian readers, or the Guardian.

The majority of the comments were jokes or facetious remarks, including unfavourable political comments (especially about Boris Johnson and other Tory politicians), references to films and TV shows, silly suggestions for films, and remarks about junk/fast food.

One comment discussed the use of used fat in cattle feed before it was banned.
