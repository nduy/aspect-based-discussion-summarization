UNCONSTRAINED SUMMARY

Most of the commenters focused on expressing their opinions on the character and actions of Prince Charles. The negative views, which accused him of being a parasite and a thief from the taxpayer, prevailed. Others suggested he was not giving enough money and that he was only doing this for the publicity of it. 

The positive commenters were fewer and focused on the fact that he did something and that he shows he cares about the people, they thought he did well by going to the flooded areas. Commenters also talked about the practices of royals to block legislation and the amount of wealth he has compared to his donation.

There was a large number of jokes about David Cameron which showed a considerable disbelief in his power as a Prime Minister. Commenters suggested he was afraid to go there and that he was to be drowned.

A lot of commenters engaged in political discussions on different topics which were related to the article. They questioned why the Secretary of the Environment did not visit and whether it was government agenda to stay clear of issues like that. They urged a return of public services and underlined that there seems to be nobody accountable for the floods. Upon the question of what Cameron's and Owen's visit would change, there were a number of answers which pointed out that it would send the right message to the public if they were there.

Only a few commenters focused on the flood itself, suggesting insurance but then opposing to the idea as it would have been unsuccessful. There was a considerable amount of personal comments and some other political jokes. There were some geographical references to fracking, connecting Cameron's interest in fracking and his lack of initiative in the flooded areas in Somerset. The tone of most of the comments was sarcastic.
