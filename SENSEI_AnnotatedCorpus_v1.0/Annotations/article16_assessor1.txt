UNCONSTRAINED SUMMARY

The comments were mostly critical. They normally focused on one of two topics to be negative about - Prince Charles or the government. 

The main issues with the government, specifically David Cameron and the Environmental Minister, was that they did not visit the areas affected by the floods. This was thought to show that they did not care about the people that were currently suffering from the extensive flooding. This led to criticism of the government in general. Some people thought that the government should not visit, but this generally was accompanied by other negative opinions about other things that the government has done such as not giving enough money to help victims of the floods. 

Some people were for the government, saying that they probably had other important things to do that were stopping them from visiting the floods. 

There were a lot of negative comments about Prince Charles, even though he donated a lot of money to help the victims of the floods. People said that the money was not his own, because it was actually taxpayers money or what had been 'stolen' by his ancestors. They also said he should not be as involved in political matters. Some were concerned that he was getting to close to politicians. 

A much smaller number of people were positive towards him. They thought he was doing more than politicians to show that he cared, and they thought it was good that he was donating money. 

There were a few comments about the floods themselves, such as discussion about if the frequency and severity of flooding will go up or down in the coming years.
