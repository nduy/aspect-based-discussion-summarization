UNCONSTRAINED SUMMARY

The largest group of commenters proposed suggestions for coping with hot weather and there was little opposition to their ideas. The most popular prepositions were closing the windows, shutters and curtains during the day so hear cannot get in; wearing light clothing and avoiding jeans and bare skin; taking cool showers or baths.

There were various other suggestions which consisted of advice on what to drink and eat and how to correctly do exercise and work while a heat wave is going on.
Not using the oven and drinking a salty yoghurt drink were two other things which the many commenters agreed on.

During the night, opening doors and windows and sleeping on the balcony or a tiled floor were the most suggested ideas.

There was a wide discussion about dogs which mainly involved the suggestion to not leave dogs in cars during the heat wave. Commenters expressed their amazement that dogs are being treated this way and others contributed personal stories on the topic. A discussion was started on the decision to ban dogs at a local beach which led to commenters accusing others and various commenters referring to the likeness of dogs and kids - or the opposite.

Commenters also questioned whether the article was relevant and useful with an equal amount on both sides. Many suggested the article is just the media over exaggerating and that it is not that hot, while others focused on how the advice inside is useless as it is common sense. The ones who were not against the article said the heat was different in different parts of the country and that many die every year from overheating so the article is not worthless.

A big part of the commenters shared personal experiences from heat waves abroad and based their opinions on that. Almost one third of the comments were jokes and sarcasm, there was a good amount of personal comments unrelated to the topics discussed, too.
