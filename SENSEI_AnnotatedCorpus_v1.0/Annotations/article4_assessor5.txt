UNCONSTRAINED SUMMARY

A good amount of comments are about  whether or not indipendendence of Scotland would affect Rosyth jobs situation (22%). half of the comments claims that chosing Indipendence for Scotland would mean loose contracts for warships since Uk wants to keep buiding them within the Union. The other half disagree, mostly because, they say, there are no more contracts in that field anyway.
Then few commentators (6) discuss about how Scotland Indipendence can demage the Uk. There's who  think that lower taxes in Scotland could bring to stealing jobs for north of England and on the other hand someone suggest to separate competition and "nasty nationalism".
Then the comments are more centred on the ships and different issues related to that.
There is a crossfire about the fact that the governament has placed ships for the RFA in South Korea. The debate is about the fact that those are not warships and so they can be offered to the best bidder but someone argues that they are, in fact warships, even if technically they aren't.
Another issue is about what does Britain need aircraft carriers for?(15%). Most of commentors think they are useless and somebody disagrees, saying that they can be used for humanitary missions.
The 15% of comments focus on whether ships and aircrafts are obsolete or not and if they worth the money.
There are few commentors suggesting that the money used for aircraft carriers could be better spent on the nhs or on renewable energy but someone disagree.
Another discussion focuses on Royal Navy and whether it has had more a peacekeeping and defensive role or a "killing machine" (9% of comments).
The 8% of comments are personal attacks to commentors or empty sarcasm, and then we have few comments about the aesthetics of warships and some jokes.
