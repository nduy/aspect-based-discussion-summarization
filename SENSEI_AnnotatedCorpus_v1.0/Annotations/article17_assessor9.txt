UNCONSTRAINED SUMMARY

Most of the commenters discussed the cost of living and housing relative to the wages. Some suggested older people do not need that much money with their debts paid off and children grown up. There was significant disagreement on that subject and some life stories to show what cost of living they have had to bear.

A big discussion was started on the topic of people's ability to make 'right' and 'wrong' choices and how it all depends on those. Many disagreed and said it depends mostly on birth and luck. A commenter argued external forces should not be blamed which resulted in many insulting and sarcastic comments directed at them.

Significant part of the comments concerned retirement and retirement age. Commenters talked about people being forced to retire and sarcastically explored the incentives that come from being made redundant. Others focused on the increasing retirement age and the difference between normal workers and civil servants, who retire earlier. An argument arose claiming taxpayers should not pay for the pension funds of civil servants.

A portion of commenters noted it was not easy in the 70s, some explaining finances and bad decisions while others joked about it. A point was made about free education as opposed to the present reality and some disagreed and went with sarcasm.

A few commenters claimed the article was pointless and a bad standard of journalism, pointing out it was just a collection of facts with no additional context.

The younger generation was a huge topic for the commenters - claiming they were entitled while older people worked hard to get where they were. There was disagreement explaining it was difficult with student loans, expensive housing and high mortgage rates.

The last thing commenters talked about was the hateful comments directed to over-50s, claiming they were not to blame and everyone has achieved what they achieved.
