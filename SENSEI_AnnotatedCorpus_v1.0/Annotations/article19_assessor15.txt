UNCONSTRAINED SUMMARY

Several commenters thought that fining Network Rail was either meaningless or counter-productive. They argued that it is really a fine on the taxpayer, as the company is publicly funded. 

A number argued that it would make more sense to fine the directors instead, or even sack them. It was pointed out that their bonuses would be cut for poor performance, but several thought that their bonuses would still be too large. It was joked that the directors were on a "gravy train".

There was some debate as to whether Network Rail should be held responsible for delays, or whether they might be the fault of the train operating companies or the weather. A joke was made suggesting that the train operating companies don't care about delays, as the regulatory system is ineffective.

Many commenters discussed whether a nationalised or privatised rail system would be better. One commenter thought the current system is bad, as it is too fractured. Another thought the break up of British Rail had caused much damage. Several thought that the system should be nationalised. One argued against nationalisation. 

Several comments expressed the view that fares are too high. There was discussion of whether the government or the train operating companies are responsible for fares. Several comments noted that Network Rail does not set fares, or operate trains.

The status of Network Rail as a "not for dividend" private company was discussed in several comments. It was noted that it will soon become an officially public body. 

Several comments addressed whether giving the fine money to the train companies to spend on improving wi-fi was a good use of the money. There was disagreement about whether the money would be better spent improving wi-fi or improving travel. 

One commenter argued that an improved rail service should be paid for by passenger only, not by taxpayers. Several others disagreed, arguing that the rail system benefits everyone, even if they don't directly use it. There was also disagreement on whether the London and South-East network is better funded, at the expense of other areas.
