UNCONSTRAINED SUMMARY

Commenters were divided into two camps - a minority sceptical about climate change and the rest who thought it manmade and dangerous. A commenter identifying as undecided was a rare exception. The sceptics were repeatedly called "denialists" and complacent that warming was merely natural, a cycle between ice ages. Several countered that recent temperature trends were in fact anomalous and manmade. Overwhelming scientific evidence had established warming from CO2 and fossil fuel impacting polar ice. This included mentions of worsening Australian droughts and increased heatwaves. A carbon tax and renewables were mentioned as remedies.

Opposing opinions were often dismissive and insulting. Conservatives were characterised as psychologically unbalanced, one triggered much derision for warning that climate predictions were used to control people. Deniers, in turn, called their opponents deluded. Suspicions were raised deniers were shills; some seemed to recognise others from online discussions. Climate change sceptics negative attitudes to science were seen as hypocritical, for their lives had benefitted from it - did they disbelieve theories like gravity too? Many exchanges concerned the validity of evidence and the scientific method - facts and statistics were sneered at, and positions labelled as dogmatic and ignorant. Several commenters argued for prudent planning to protect societies from the potentially catastrophic risks. Warming would mean the advent of Dengue fever to Australia, malaria spreading, economic pressures, wars and heatwaves. 

The Australian government was criticised for inaction over climate change. Comments were sarcastic about bureaucracy and funding cuts to scientific research - why was the Australian Academy of Science having to fund the advocacy? Some blamed lobbying by corporate and fossil fuel interests - who were compared to the tobacco industry for suppressing dangers to public health. The press and media were attacked for their role.

CONSTRAINED SUMMARY

Commenters were divided into two camps - a minority sceptical about climate change and the rest who thought it man-made and dangerous. A commenter identifying as undecided provided a rare exception. Sceptics (repeatedly charged as "denialists") were complacent that warming was merely a natural cycle between ice ages. Several countered this that recent temperature trends were  anomalous and man-made. Overwhelming scientific evidence had established warming from CO2 impacting polar ice. It had led to worsening Australian droughts and heatwaves. A carbon tax and renewables were mentioned as remedies.

Opposing opinions were often dismissive and insulting. Conservatives were characterised as psychologically unbalanced, one triggered much derision for warning that climate predictions were used to control people. Deniers, in turn, called others deluded. Suspicions were raised deniers were shills; some seemed to recognise others from elsewhere online. Climate change scepticism about science was hypocritical - had they not benefitted from it? Did they disbelieve theories like gravity too? Many exchanges concerned the validity of evidence and the scientific method - facts and statistics were sneered at, and positions labelled as dogmatic. Several argued for planning to protect society from the potentially catastrophic risks. Warming would lead to Dengue fever in Australia, economic pressures, wars and heatwaves. 

The government was criticised for inaction over climate change, including funding cuts to scientific research and advocacy. Some blamed lobbying by corporate and fossil fuel interests - likened to the tobacco industry for suppressing dangers to public health. The media was also criticised.
