UNCONSTRAINED SUMMARY

The vast majority of comments were very negative towards the changes to bin collections. 

The only positive comments were that it would be a positive move for recycling. Littlerichie thought it was a good idea to force people to recycle more. They said: "If 75% of this borough composted their waste at home then they could have their bins collected every six-weeks. It's amazing what doesn't need to be put into landfill." Other people said that they managed fine as they were, and many said that they did not put their bins out every time there was a collection. These people almost boasted that they were eco-friendly and produced little rubbish, which enraged other posters, while other people had problems already. 

Many more people were angry with the proposals. Their main concerns were increased levels of vermin (specifically rats and foxes), not having enough space in their bins, communal bins in flats and issues with disposing of children's waste (mainly nappies, but also that children generally produce more waste than adults). 

The comments about vermin mainly revolved around the issue of rubbish left for three weeks would attract rats and foxes. Some people replied saying that it should not be an issue because people with compost bins do not have more vermin than other people.

Lots of people compared how much waste they create. Some showed off about the high amount of recycling that they managed to do, while others said that they couldn't believe how they did it. Parents with babies had the biggest issues with disposing of soiled nappies. There was a debate over which type of nappy was better for the environment between the waste produced from single-use nappies to the cleaning costs of hot water to wash multi-use nappies. 

A few people talked about the issues with throwing away rubbish in large communal housing, such as at blocks of flats where lots of people will produce a lot of rubbish which would build up over three weeks. However, someone pointed out that the article says that flats will get different circumstances. 

Many people blamed the Council for the cuts to waste services. Few people identified that the 50% cuts were imposed by central government, that local Councils then had to implement.
