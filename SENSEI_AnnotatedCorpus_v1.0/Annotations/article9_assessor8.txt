UNCONSTRAINED SUMMARY

A mainly convivial discussion saw most comments offering often detailed, practical advice on how to deal with the hot weather. The first comment, for example, told how Portugal copes in the heat, and was endorsed by many others. Lots agreed on keeping homes cool by closing shutters (most effective), curtains and windows as a barrier during daytime sunshine. Several extended such airflow advice to using fans and opening windows etc at night and on shaded sides of houses. Occasionally comments complained at obvious advice but many more contributed and were appreciative. Indeed sleeping was problematic for many and advised cold baths or showers, using dampened bedding or towels, or even sleeping on the floor or balcony.

Much helpful, general advice included keeping to shade, doing chores and working early or later on, siestas and moving slowly. Cool oneself also by wetting hats, wrists and hands and tying hair up.  Some advocated limiting meal cooking in such heat and eating less. Even more mentioned staying hydrated and avoiding alcohol. Many agreed on covering up sensibly and loose clothing - not jeans. Various unusual and humorous comments suggested ingesting diverse foods and vitamins, salted or sugared water, wearing thermal socks or having sex - various jokes followed this latter tip. Vague advice to "go somewhere cooler" was met with silliness including supermarket freezers and the coolness of Patrick Stewart. 

Much negative discussion debated how hot the UK really was. Some sarcastically complained it was exaggerated, and some were still using duvets (but later others claimed difficulties sleeping). Several dismissed such moaning, one pointing out it was over 75 since June and warned of hotter temperatures. 

Many criticised British inadequacy in hot weather compared with other countries. Wearing fewer clothes and getting burned were mentioned. Several countered that this weather was exceptional and the humidity here. Foreign experiences of hot weather and precautions was often discussed, regularly mentioning temperature levels. Several enthused about moving abroad and yogurt, especially Turkish Ayran.

Finally, comments - often angry - mentioned the dangers to people and especially responsibility regarding dogs, who should never be left in cars.
