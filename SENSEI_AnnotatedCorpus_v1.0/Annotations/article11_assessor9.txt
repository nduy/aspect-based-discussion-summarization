UNCONSTRAINED SUMMARY

The commenters mainly focused on what can be done to contain the spread of Ebola to Britain and whether or not Ebola is easily contractible. 

Some vouched for stronger border control as a way to stop infected people coming to the UK but others said it was expensive and ineffective. The topic escalated to accusing commenters of being anti-immigration and noting that closing the borders may be seen as such an act against foreigners traveling to the UK. Other commenters suggested sending to help to Africa or battling the infection's centre as an alternative to contain Ebola. Only one commenter said closing borders and sending help are not exclusive.There was a discussion that the topic was attracting xenophobes and those were always quick to comment. There were as much people who said closing borders is anti-immigration as those who only explained the need of protecting one's country and public health.

Among commenters, a wide discussion occurred, taking up almost half of the comments, about whether Ebola is easy to catch or not. Many said it was easy because of doctors protecting themselves and countries closing borders but many also said it is not contracted by air - hence it is difficult to get it. There were other comments concerning Ebola such as that there has been no outbreak in a rich country so far and a few jokes.

There was a short discussion concerning that information about Ebola may not be credible anymore, with an end result of people complaining no matter what steps are taken. The media coverage of the subject was also mentioned - saying that they should have covered it sooner when it was active in Africa.

There were other singular comments not related to any of these discussions and about 15% of the comments were of personal nature.
