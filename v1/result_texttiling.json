I appreciate that there may be trouble with households using disposable nappies but If they are sealed up properly and the bin is closed it shouldn't be a problem. Our neighbour used to throw lots of disposable nappies in our grey bin and they often sat there for 4 weeks with no issues. I regularly walk past lots of grey bins in the Bury region that are spilling over with recyclable material like glass bottles, paper and cardboard.  Part of the solution in raising recycling rates should focus on more education about what can be recycled and consideration of fines/rewards to encourage good attitudes to waste disposal for the minority who refuse to change their behaviour.",

We purchase a fair few items, and even the recyclable elements can be difficult to accommodate (e.g. crushing large play pen boxes). Squashing plastic bottles is also well and good if the bottle tops are recyclable; if they aren't the bottles often open up again. This is irrelevant though to us as we manage with the recyclable bins (just).

One might suspect that the greenest recycling would be no garbage pickup at all. Instead, residents could take their own rubbish to the tip. Oh wait, that doesn't make any environmental sense at all. But it's already happening. I have to routinely take extra black bags to the tip because there is insufficient space in the bin for hoover bags, wood offcuts, styrofoam packaging, paint cans etc. That's before we get into serious gardening (burn it, that's environmentally helpful). Meanwhile the compostable recycling for e.g. chicken carcasses bakes under a hot sun and produces a remarkable crop of maggots and the interest of foxes. The non-recyclables bin gets pushed over from time to time because it's unstable and the only place to leave it is on a slope. That inevitably attracts vermin.  I dread the fact that if Bury gets away with it, all the rest will follow. And I resent the fact that this is all in reality about austerity and corner cutting because of central government meddling.

My view is that if central government cuts a council's funding by 50%, then it must at some point be central government's fault when that council can't provide basic services. Rats, to be blunt, are the least of their problems - they are also responsible for home care to the disabled and elderly, a service which is literally a matter of life and death to some people. Appallingly, many councils have been cutting that by huge percentages, in order to cater to concerns like weekly bin collections - I think largely because disabled people can't dump rubbish on their councillors' driveways. I don't dispute that many people will not be able to manage their rubbish on three weekly collections, just with where the blame lies for that.",
